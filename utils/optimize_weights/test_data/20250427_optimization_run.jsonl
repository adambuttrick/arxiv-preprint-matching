While most existing MF methods assume a fixed dataset, adaptive sampling methods that dynamically allocate resources among fidelity models can achieve higher efficiency in the exploring and exploiting the design space. However, most existing MF methods rely on the hierarchical assumption of fidelity levels or fail to capture the intercorrelation between multiple fidelity levels and utilize it to quantify the value of the future samples and navigate the adaptive sampling. To address this hurdle, we propose a framework hinged on a latent embedding for different fidelity models and the associated pre-posterior analysis to explicitly utilize their correlation for adaptive sampling. In this framework, each infill sampling iteration includes two steps: We first identify the location of interest with the greatest potential improvement using the high-fidelity (HF) model, then we search for the next sample across all fidelity levels that maximize the improvement per unit cost at the location identified in the first step. This is made possible by a single Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) model that maps different fidelity models into an interpretable latent space to capture their correlations without assuming hierarchical fidelity levels. The LVGP enables us to assess how LF sampling candidates will affect HF response with pre-posterior analysis and determine the next sample with the best benefit-to-cost ratio. Through test cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark methods in both MF global fitting (GF) and Bayesian Optimization (BO) problems in convergence rate and robustness. Moreover, the method offers the flexibility to switch between GF and BO by simply changing the acquisition function.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03298","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-10-06T01:32:46Z","registered":"2023-10-06T01:32:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-02-06T03:41:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here we present high-resolution Chandra X-ray Observatory and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of five nearby BCDs with stellar masses of less than the Small Magellanic Cloud ($M_\\star \\sim 10^{7} - 10^{8.4}$ $M_\\odot$). We search for signatures of accreting massive BHs at X-ray and radio wavelengths, which are more sensitive to lower BH accretion rates than optical searches. We detect a total of 10 hard X-ray sources and 10 compact radio sources at luminosities consistent with star-formation-related emission. We find one case of a spatially-coincident X-ray and radio source within the astrometric uncertainties. If the X-ray and radio emission are indeed coming from the same source, the origin of the radiation is plausibly from an active massive BH with log $(M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}) \\sim 4.8 \\pm 1.1$. However, given that the X-ray and radio emission are also coincident with a young star cluster complex, we consider the combination of an X-ray binary and a supernova remnant (or \\HII region) a viable alternative explanation. Overall, we do not find compelling evidence for active massive BHs in our target BCDs, which on average have stellar masses more than an order of magnitude lower than previous samples of dwarf galaxies found to host massive BHs. Our results suggest that moderately accreting massive BHs in BCDs are not so common as to permit unambiguous detection in a small sample.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12585","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-28T04:22:52Z","registered":"2022-02-28T04:22:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-06-27T01:00:21Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Research works towards computational techniques that facilitate the design process, such as automated analysis and optimization, often use simple floorplan representations that ignore the semantics of the space and do not take into account usage related analytics. We present a floorplan embedding technique that uses an attributed graph to represent the geometric information as well as design semantics and behavioral features of the inhabitants as node and edge attributes. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture is proposed and trained to embed attributed graphs as vectors in a continuous space. A user study is conducted to evaluate the coupling of similar floorplans retrieved from the embedding space with respect to a given input (e.g., design layout). The qualitative, quantitative and user-study evaluations show that our embedding framework produces meaningful and accurate vector representations for floorplans.

Spanning the wide bandgap of amorphous InGaZnO$_x$ (a-IGZO), UBPC identifies seven oxygen-deep donor vacancy peaks that are independently confirmed by energetically matching to photoluminescence emission peaks. The sub-gap DoS from 15 different types of a-IGZO TFTs all yield similar DoS, except only back-channel etch TFTs can have a deep acceptor peak seen at 2.2 eV below the conduction band mobility edge. This deep acceptor is likely a zinc vacancy, evidenced by trap density which becomes 5-6x larger when TFT wet-etch methods are employed. Certain DoS peaks are strongly enhanced for TFTs with active channel processing damage caused by plasma exposure. While Ar implantation and He plasma processing damage are similar, Ar plasma yields more disorder showing a 2x larger valence-band Urbach energy and two orders of magnitude increase in the deep oxygen vacancy trap density. Changing the growth conditions of a-IGZO also impacts the DoS, with zinc-rich TFTs showing much poorer electrical performance compared to 1:1:1 molar ratio a-IGZO TFTs owing to the former having a ~10xlarger oxygen vacancy trap density. Finally, hydrogen is found to behave as a donor in amorphous indium tin gallium zinc oxide TFTs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 6 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08196","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-01-20T01:54:04Z","registered":"2023-01-20T01:54:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-03-14T01:52:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, obtaining CSI through feedback from the user equipment (UE) becomes challenging with the increasing scale of antennas and subcarriers and leads to extremely high CSI feedback overhead. Deep learning-based methods have emerged for compressing CSI but these methods generally require substantial collected samples and thus pose practical challenges. Moreover, existing deep learning methods also suffer from dramatically growing feedback overhead owing to their focus on full-dimensional CSI feedback. To address these issues, we propose a low-overhead Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI feedback Framework (IEFSF) for massive MIMO systems. An incorporation-extrapolation scheme for eigenvector-based CSI feedback is proposed to reduce the feedback overhead. Then, to alleviate the necessity of extensive collected samples and enable few-shot CSI feedback, we further propose a knowledge-driven data augmentation (KDDA) method and an artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) -based data augmentation method by exploiting the domain knowledge of wireless channels and by exploiting a novel generative model, respectively. Experimental results based on the DeepMIMO dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEFSF significantly reduces CSI feedback overhead by 64 times compared with existing methods while maintaining higher feedback accuracy using only several hundred collected samples.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables.

In recent work, we have shown that such systems relax locally to a maximum entropy ensemble that we have dubbed the PT-symmetric generalized Gibbs ensemble (PTGGE), in analogy to the generalized Gibbs ensemble that describes the steady state of isolated integrable quantum many-body systems after a quench. Here, using driven-dissipative versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the Kitaev chain as paradigmatic model systems, we corroborate and substantially expand upon our previous results. In particular, we confirm the validity of a dissipative quasiparticle picture at finite dissipation by demonstrating light cone spreading of correlations and the linear growth and saturation to the PTGGE prediction of the quasiparticle-pair contribution to the subsystem entropy in the PT-symmetric phase. Further, we introduce the concept of directional pumping phases, which is related to the non-Hermitian topology of the Liouvillian and based upon qualitatively different dynamics of the dual string order parameter and the subsystem fermion parity in the SSH model and the Kitaev chain, respectively: Depending on the postquench parameters, there can be pumping of string order and fermion parity through both ends of a subsystem corresponding to a finite segment of the one-dimensional lattice, through only one end, or there can be no pumping at all. We show that transitions between dynamical pumping phases give rise to a new and independent type of dynamical critical behavior of the rates of directional pumping, which are determined by the soft modes of the PTGGE.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"37 pages, 19 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01836","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-04-05T02:32:07Z","registered":"2023-04-05T02:32:08Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-02-20T04:18:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The model incorporates star-formation and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion in a co-evolution scenario to fit simultaneously 617 data points of number counts, redshift distributions and local luminosity functions (LFs) with 19 free parameters. The model has four main components, the total IR LF, the SMBH accretion energy fraction in the IR band, the star-formation SED and the unobscured SMBH SED extinguished with a HI column density distribution. As a result of the observational uncertainties about the star-formation and SMBH SEDs, we present several variants of the model. The best-fit reduced chi^2 reaches as small as 2.7-2.9 of which a significant amount (&gt;0.8) is contributed by cosmic variances or caveats associated with data. Compared to previous models, the unique result of this model is to constrain the SMBH energy fraction in the IR band that is found to increase with the IR luminosity but decrease with redshift up to z ~ 1.5; this result is separately verified using aromatic feature equivalent width data. The joint modelling of X-ray and mid-IR data allows for improved constraints on the obscured AGN, especially the Compton-thick AGN population. All variants of the model require that Compton-thick AGN fractions decrease with the SMBH luminosity but increase with redshift while the type-1 AGN fraction has the reverse trend.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"32 pages, 18 figures, ApJ in press.

This leaves the application's confidential data vulnerable to theft and leakage by malicious code and inadvertent bugs in the third-party scripts. Security mechanisms in modern browsers (the same-origin policy, cross-origin resource sharing and content security policies) are too coarse to suit this programming model. All these mechanisms (and their extensions) describe whether or not a script can access certain data, whereas the meaningful requirement is to allow untrusted scripts access to confidential data that they need and to prevent the scripts from leaking data on the side. Motivated by this gap, we propose WebPol, a policy mechanism that allows a website developer to include fine-grained policies on confidential application data in the familiar syntax of the JavaScript programming language. The policies can be associated with any webpage element, and specify what aspects of the element can be accessed by which third-party domains. A script can access data that the policy allows it to, but it cannot pass the data (or data derived from it) to other scripts or remote hosts in contravention of the policy. To specify the policies, we expose a small set of new native APIs in JavaScript.

The deflectors are nearly stationary in a scattering screen that is thin (&lt; 5% of the pulsar-observer distance in extent), is located 70% of the way from the Earth to the pulsar, and has been seen consistently in observations dating back 20 years. The pulsar scans the scattering screen at a velocity of 110 km/s with a detection radius of 15 mas. Pulsar observations such as these -- particularly with a new generation of low-frequency radio telescopes with large collecting areas -- hold promise for improving constraints on the poorly understood physical characteristics and space density of the deflecting structures. Such observations may also prove useful in correcting deviations the deflectors produce in high-precision timing of millarcsecond pulsars.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 4 figures; submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411752","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T03:12:01Z","registered":"2022-03-18T03:12:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T03:12:02Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The properties of such a component are normally summarised as a perfect fluid with a (potentially) time-dependent equation-of-state parameter $w(z)$. We investigate the evolution of this parameter with redshift by performing a Bayesian analysis of current cosmological observations. We model the temporal evolution as piecewise linear in redshift between `nodes', whose $w$-values and redshifts are allowed to vary. The optimal number of nodes is chosen by the Bayesian evidence. In this way, we can both determine the complexity supported by current data and locate any features present in $w(z)$. We compare this node-based reconstruction with some previously well-studied parameterisations: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), the Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP) and the Felice-Nesseris-Tsujikawa (FNT). By comparing the Bayesian evidence for all of these models we find an indication towards possible time-dependence in the dark energy equation-of-state. It is also worth noting that the CPL and JBP models are strongly disfavoured, whilst the FNT is just significantly disfavoured, when compared to a simple cosmological constant $w=-1$. We find that our node-based reconstruction model is slightly disfavoured with respect to the $\u039b$CDM model.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 5 figures, minor corrections","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0847","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T00:47:51Z","registered":"2022-03-13T00:47:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T00:47:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In our approach, PCG is first voxelized, scaled and partitioned into non-overlapped 3D cubes, which is then fed into stacked 3D convolutions for compact latent feature and hyperprior generation. Hyperpriors are used to improve the conditional probability modeling of latent features. A weighted binary cross-entropy (WBCE) loss is applied in training while an adaptive thresholding is used in inference to remove unnecessary voxels and reduce the distortion. Objectively, our method exceeds the geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC) algorithm standardized by well-known Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) with a significant performance margin, e.g., at least 60% BD-Rate (Bjontegaard Delta Rate) gains, using common test datasets. Subjectively, our method has presented better visual quality with smoother surface reconstruction and appealing details, in comparison to all existing MPEG standard compliant PCC methods. Our method requires about 2.5MB parameters in total, which is a fairly small size for practical implementation, even on embedded platform. Additional ablation studies analyze a variety of aspects (e.g., cube size, kernels, etc) to explore the application potentials of our learned-PCGC.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12037","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T11:44:35Z","registered":"2022-02-27T11:44:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-10-11T01:40:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Despite using the same architecture for the machine learning model, we showcase how the model's learning and prediction behavior differs once trained on distinct data. We use two data sets for illustration: a mixed-source data set that integrates experimental and computational crystal samples and a single-source data set consisting of data exclusively from one computational database. We present simple procedures to detect data bias and to evaluate its effect on the model's performance and generalization.

The nucleon-nucleon correlations induced by the short-range and tensor components of the interaction yield an enhancement of the momentum distribution at high momenta as compared to the Hartree-Fock description. These high-momentum components should be observed mainly in nucleon knockout reactions like $(e,e'p)$ leaving the final nucleus in a state of high excitation energy. Our analysis also demonstrates that non-negligible contributions to the momentum distribution should be found in partial waves which are unoccupied in the simple shell-model.

Ion charge state and composition analyses suggest that the origin of the seed particle population for the mechanisms of particle acceleration at CME-driven shocks is not the bulk solar wind thermal material, but rather a suprathermal population present in the solar wind. This suprathermal population could result from remnant material accelerated in prior solar flares and/or preceding CME-driven shocks. In this work, we examine the distribution of this suprathermal particle population in the inner heliosphere by combining a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the solar wind and a Monte-Carlo simulation of particle acceleration and transport. Assuming that the seed particles are uniformly distributed near the Sun by solar flares of various magnitudes, we study the longitudinal distribution of the seed population at multiple heliocentric distances. We consider a non-uniform background solar wind, consisting of fast and slow streams that lead to compression and rarefaction regions within the solar wind. Our simulations show that the seed population at a particular location (e.g., 1 au) is strongly modulated by the underlying solar wind configuration. Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) and merged interactions regions (MIRs) can strongly alter the energy spectra of the seed particle populations. In addition, cross-field diffusion plays an important role in mitigating strong variations of the seed population in both space and energy.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09098","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-04-19T01:03:11Z","registered":"2023-04-19T01:03:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-04-19T01:03:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The optimal ways of sensing and control in the run-and-tumble chemotaxis have been analyzed theoretically to elucidate the efficiency of strategies implemented in organisms. However, because of theoretical difficulties, most of attempts have been limited only to either linear or deterministic analysis even though real biological chemotactic systems involve considerable stochasticity and nonlinearity in their sensory processes and controlled responses. In this paper, by combining the theories of optimal filtering and Kullback-Leibler control of partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), we derive the optimal and fully nonlinear strategy for controlling run-and-tumble motion depending on noisy sensing of ligand gradient. The derived optimal strategy consists of the optimal filtering dynamics to estimate the run-direction from noisy sensory input and the control function to regulate the motor output. We further show that this optimal strategy can be associated naturally with a standard biochemical model and experimental data of the Escherichia coli's chemotaxis. These results demonstrate that our theoretical framework can work as a basis for analyzing the efficiency and optimality of run-and-tumble chemotaxis.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12405","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-23T07:44:14Z","registered":"2022-02-23T07:44:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-12-31T03:59:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We model these systems using a viscous eikonal equation posed on the plane, and represent the defect as a perturbation. In contrast to previous results we consider large defects, which we describe using a function with slow algebraic decay, i.e., $g \\sim {\\mathcal O}(1/|x|^m)$ for $m \\in (1,2]$. We prove that these defects are able to generate target patterns and that, just as in the case of strongly localized impurities, their frequency is small beyond all orders of the small parameter describing their strength. Our analysis consists of finding two approximations to target pattern solutions, one which is valid at intermediate scales and a second one which is valid in the far field. This is done using weighted Sobolev spaces, which allow us to recover Fredholm properties of the relevant linear operators, as well as the implicit function theorem, which is then used to prove existence.

This form of differential rotation, also observed in many other low-mass stars, is understood to arise when Coriolis effects are stronger than those associated with buoyant driving of the convection. When buoyancy dominates, a so-called antisolar state of differential rotation results, characterized by rapidly-rotating poles and a slow equator. The transition between these two states has been shown to occur when the intensity of these two forces is roughly equal or, equivalently, when the convective Rossby number of the system is unity. Here we consider an alternative view of the transition that relates this phenomenon to convective structure and convective-zone depth. Using a series of 3-D rotating convection-zone simulations, we demonstrate that the solar/antisolar transition occurs when the columnar convective structures characteristic of rotating convection attain a diameter roughly equivalent to the shell depth. When the characteristic convective wavelength exceeds twice the shell depth, we find that the coherent convective structures necessary to sustain an equatorward Reynolds stress are lost, and an antisolar state results. We conclude by presenting a force-balance analysis that relates this geometric interpretation of the transition to the convective-Rossby-number criteria identified in previous studies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05591","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-08-12T00:43:09Z","registered":"2022-08-12T00:43:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-10-27T01:14:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The efficiency of meta-modeling techniques relies on their ability to provide statistically-equivalent analytical representations based on relatively few evaluations of the original model. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) have proven a powerful tool for developing meta-models in a wide range of applications; the key idea thereof is to expand the model response onto a basis made of multivariate polynomials obtained as tensor products of appropriate univariate polynomials. The classical PCE approach nevertheless faces the \"curse of dimensionality\", namely the exponential increase of the basis size with increasing input dimension. To address this limitation, the sparse PCE technique has been proposed, in which the expansion is carried out on only a few relevant basis terms that are automatically selected by a suitable algorithm. An alternative for developing meta-models with polynomial functions in high-dimensional problems is offered by the newly emerged low-rank approximations (LRA) approach. By exploiting the tensor-product structure of the multivariate basis, LRA can provide polynomial representations in highly compressed formats. Through extensive numerical investigations, we herein first shed light on issues relating to the construction of canonical LRA with a particular greedy algorithm involving a sequential updating of the polynomial coefficients along separate dimensions. Canonical LRA exhibit smaller errors than sparse PCE in cases when the number of available model evaluations is small with respect to the input dimension. By introducing the conditional generalization error, we further demonstrate that canonical LRA tend to outperform sparse PCE in the prediction of extreme model responses.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07492","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T09:52:32Z","registered":"2022-03-07T09:52:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T09:52:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The second goal is to use the setup presented in the first demonstration to show that this equivalence can be achieved also in a real multi-component scalar field model again without a specific form for its Lagrangian.

It is shown that even without a detailed calculation of the pressure anisotropy or the heat fluxes, one finds the macroscale dynamics to be generically unstable to microscale Alfvenically polarized fluctuations. Two instabilities are considered in detail: the parallel firehose instability (including the finite-Larmor-radius effects that determine the fastest growing mode) and the gyrothermal instability (GTI). The latter is a new result - it is shown that a parallel ion heat flux destabilizes Alfvenically polarized fluctuations even in the absence of the negative pressure anisotropy required for the firehose. The main conclusion is that both pressure anisotropies and heat fluxes trigger plasma microinstabilities and, therefore, their values will likely be set by the nonlinear evolution of these instabilities. Ideas for understanding this nonlinear evolution are discussed. It is argued that cosmic plasmas will generically be \"three-scale systems,\" comprising global dynamics, mesoscale turbulence and microscale plasma fluctuations. The astrophysical example of cool cores of galaxy clusters is considered and it is noted that observations point to turbulence in clusters being in a marginal state with respect to plasma microinstabilities and so it is the plasma microphysics that is likely to set the heating and conduction properties of the intracluster medium. In particular, a lower bound on the scale of temperature fluctuations implied by the GTI is derived.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, MNRAS tex style, 1 figure","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.1359","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T08:41:46Z","registered":"2022-03-15T08:41:48Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T08:41:48Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The planet's mass M_p= 13.4+-0.9 M_J places it right at the deuterium burning limit, i.e., the conventional boundary between \"planets\" and \"brown dwarfs\". Its existence raises the question of whether such objects are really \"planets\" (formed within the disks of their hosts) or \"failed stars\" (low mass objects formed by gas fragmentation). This question may ultimately be addressed by comparing disk and bulge/bar planets, which is a goal of the Spitzer microlens program. The host is a G dwarf M_host = 0.89+-0.07 M_sun and the planet has a semi-major axis a~2.0 AU. We use Kepler K2 Campaign 9 microlensing data to break the lens-mass degeneracy that generically impacts parallax solutions from Earth-Spitzer observations alone, which is the first successful application of this approach. The microlensing data, derived primarily from near-continuous, ultra-dense survey observations from OGLE, MOA, and three KMTNet telescopes, contain more orbital information than for any previous microlensing planet, but not quite enough to accurately specify the full orbit. However, these data do permit the first rigorous test of microlensing orbital-motion measurements, which are typically derived from data taken over &lt;1% of an orbital period.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"63 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables, AJ, in press","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09974","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T23:19:19Z","registered":"2022-03-03T23:19:20Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T23:19:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We focus on the mechanical behavior of knots in tight configurations, for which the full 3D deformation must be taken into account. To set up the topology of our knotted structures, we apply a sequence of prescribed displacement steps to the centerline of an initially straight rod that is meshed with 3D solid elements. Self-contact is enforced with a normal penalty force combined with Coulomb friction. As test cases, we investigate both overhand and figure-of-eight knots. Our simulations are validated with precision model experiments, combining rod fabrication and X-ray tomography. Even if the focus is given to the methods, our results reveal that 3D deformation of tight elastic knots is central to their mechanical response. These findings contrast to a previous analysis of loose knots, for which 1D centerline-based rod theories sufficed for a predictive understanding. Our method serves as a robust framework to access complex mechanical behavior of tightly knotted structures that are not readily available through experiments nor existing reduced-order theories.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09109","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T02:49:28Z","registered":"2022-02-24T02:49:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T02:49:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Although unstable in its pure form, it has been shown that functionalization may stabilize its structure. A question that arises is whether its outstanding electronic properties could also be further improved using such a procedure. As PG bilayers present both sp$^2$ and sp$^3$ carbon planes, it consists of a flexible candidate for functionalization tuning of electromagnetic properties. In this work, we perform density functional theory simulations to investigate how the electronic and structural properties of PG bilayers can be tuned as a result of substitution doping. Specifically, we observed the emergence of different magnetic properties when boron was used as dopant species. On the other hand, in the case of doping with oxygen, the rupture of bonds in the sp$^2$ planes does not induce a magnetic moment in the material.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages and 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10941","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T05:27:05Z","registered":"2022-02-25T05:27:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T05:27:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Shocked region analysis via low excitation ions shows that major deviations from the general inside to outside ionisation trend correspond only to regions where FLIERs or LISs are located. The reduction on the SNR at the outskirts of the [O III]/H alpha ratio maps, made us unable to unambiguously identified for an enhancement on the [O III]/H alpha line ratio as an indicator for shocks.

Best fit models show a very well representation of the [O III] and H alpha emission. Discrepancies in the model fittings to the [N II] and [S II] profiles at NGC 6826 and NGC 3242, can be attributed in the former case, due to a contamination by the light of the CSPN and, in the latter case, either due to gas inhomogeneities within the clumps or to a leaking of UV radiation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01787","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T19:15:20Z","registered":"2022-03-01T19:15:21Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T19:15:21Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The original calculus from the mentioned paper did not provide the decidability result for ISCI. There are two problems to be solved in order to obtain this result: the so called loops characteristic for intuitionistic logic and the lack of the subformula property due to the form of the identity-dedicated rules. We discuss possible routes to overcome these problems: we consider a weaker version of the subformula property, guarded by the complexity of formulas which can be included within it; we also present a proof-search procedure such that when it fails, then there exists a countermodel (in Kripke semantics for ISCI).","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"In Proceedings NCL 2022, arXiv:2204.06359","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06728","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-04-15T01:08:11Z","registered":"2022-04-15T01:08:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-04-15T01:08:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In our continuing effort to understand hadronic matter at high density, we have developed a unified field theoretic formalism for dense skyrmion matter using a single Lagrangian to describe simultaneously both matter and meson fluctuations and studied in-medium properties of hadrons. The effective theory used is the Skyrme model Lagrangian gauged with the vector mesons rho and omega, implemented with the dilaton field that describes the spontaneously broken scale symmetry of QCD, in a form consistent with the symmetries of QCD and our expectations regarding the high density limit. We analyze the restoration of scale invariance and chiral symmetry as the density of the system increases. In order to preserve the restoration of scale symmetry and chiral symmetry, signalled in our case by the vanishing of the expectation value of the dilaton, and to be consistent with the vector manifestation of hidden local symmetry, a density dependent omega coupling is introduced. We uncover the crucial role played by both the dilaton and the omega meson in the phase structure of dense medium and discover how two different phase transition regimes arise as we dial the dilaton mass.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1374","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T12:05:15Z","registered":"2022-03-17T12:05:18Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T12:05:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

I argue that this 'inter-hemispheric imbalance' model arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the roles played by inter-hemispheric (callosal) projections in mammalian brains. Drawing upon a large body of empirical data, derived largely from animal models, and associated theoretical modeling, it is demonstrated that inter-hemispheric projections perform contrast enhancing and integrative functions via mechanisms such as surround/lateral inhibition. The principal functional unit of callosal influence comprises a facilitatory centre and a depressing peripheral zone, that together shape the influence of converging inputs to pyramidal neurons. Inter-hemispheric inhibition is an instance of a more general feature of mammalian neural systems, whereby inhibitory interneurons act not simply to prevent over-excitation but to sculpt the output of specific circuits. The narrowing of the excitatory focus that occurs through crossed surround inhibition is a highly conserved motif of transcallosal interactions in mammalian sensory and motor cortices. A case is presented that the notion of 'inter-hemispheric imbalance' has been sustained, and clinical interventions derived from this model promoted, by erroneous assumptions concerning that revealed by investigative techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The alternative perspective promoted by the present analysis, also permits the basis of positive (e.g. post stroke) associations between the structural integrity of transcallosal projections and motor capability to be better understood.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"45 pages (including references and figure legends), 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05774","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T23:58:42Z","registered":"2022-02-25T23:58:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T23:58:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The main interest in the study of fractal properties in such physical phenomena lies in the close relationships they have with chaotic and turbulent dynamic. In this work we introduce some statistical tools for fractal analysis of light curves: Rescaled Range Analysis (R/S), Multifractal Spectra Analysis, and Coarse Graining Spectral Analysis (CGSA), an FFT based algorithm, which can discriminate in a time series the stochastic fractal power spectra from the harmonic one. An interesting application of fractal analysis in asteroseismology concerns the joint use of all these tools in order to develop classification criteria and algorithms for \u03b4-Scuti pulsating stars. In fact from the fractal and multi-fractal fingerprints in background noise of light curves we could infer on different mechanism of stellar dynamic, among them rotation, modes excitation and magnetic activity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 10 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05297","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T04:20:56Z","registered":"2022-03-02T04:20:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T04:20:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is based on a simultaneous excitation on the target with a pulsed laser and continuous wave (CW) ultrasound. The thermoelastically induced expansion will modulate the CW ultrasound and leads to transient Doppler frequency shift. The reported mDPA effect can be described as frequency modulation of the intense CW ultrasound carrier through photoacoustic vibrations. This technique may open the possibility to sensitively detect the photoacoustic vibration in deep optically and acoustically scattering medium, avoiding acoustic distortion that exists in state-of-the-art pulsed photoacoustic imaging systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7262","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T20:58:59Z","registered":"2022-03-08T20:59:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T20:59:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A correct decoding of such information from the observed Stokes profiles requires a clear understanding of the effects that radiatively induced quantum interferences (or coherences) between pairs of magnetic sublevels produce on these observables, in the absence and in the presence of magnetic fields of arbitrary strength. Here we present a detailed theoretical investigation on the role of coherences between pairs of sublevels pertaining to different fine-structure J-levels, clarifying when they can be neglected for facilitating the modeling of the linear polarization produced by scattering processes in spectral lines. To this end, we apply the quantum theory of spectral line polarization and calculate the linear polarization patterns of the radiation scattered at 90 degrees by a slab of stellar atmospheric plasma, taking into account and neglecting the above-mentioned quantum interferences. Particular attention is given to the 2S-2P, 5S-5P, and 3P-3S multiplets. We point out the observational signatures of this kind of interferences and analyze their sensitivity to the energy separation between the interfering levels, to the amount of emissivity in the background continuum radiation, to lower-level polarization, and to the presence of a magnetic field. Some interesting applications to the following spectral lines are also presented: CaII H and K, MgII h and k, NaI D1 and D2, the BaII 4554A and 4934A resonance lines, the CrI triplet at 5207A, the OI triplet at 7773A, the MgI b-lines, and the H-alpha and Ly-alpha lines of HI.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0424","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T18:43:34Z","registered":"2022-03-12T18:43:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T18:43:35Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For such purpose, we built a compartmental model with three distinct subpopulations, namely religious committed individuals, religious noncommitted individuals and not religious affiliated individuals. The transitions among the compartments are governed by probabilities, modeling social interactions among the groups and also spontaneous transitions among the compartments. First of all, we consider the model on a fully-connected network. Thus, we write a set of ordinary differential equations to study the evolution of the subpopulations. Our analytical and numerical results show that there is an absorbing state in the model where only one of the subpopulations survive in the long-time limit. There are also regions of parameters where some of the subpopulations coexist (two or three). We also verified the occurrence of two distinct critical points. In addition, we also present Monte Carlo simulations of the model on two-dimensional square lattices, in order to analyze the impact of the presence of a lattice structure on the critical behavior of the model. Comparison of the models' results with data for religious affiliation in Northern Ireland shows a good qualitative agreement. Finally, we considered the presence of inflexible individuals in the population, i.e., individuals that never change their states. The impact of such special agents on the critical behavior of the model is also discussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"26 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Physica A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09488","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-05-16T01:37:03Z","registered":"2024-05-16T01:37:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-06-28T02:07:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Although different options have been proposed, involving e.g. intermediate mass direct collapse black holes, BH remnants of massive stars remain the most natural explanation. To identify the most favorable conditions (if any) for their rapid growth, we study the accretion rate of a M_BH = 100M_sun BH formed in a typical z = 10 galaxy under different conditions (e.g. galaxy structure, BH initial position and velocity). We model the galaxy baryonic content and follow the BH orbit and accretion history for 300 Myr (the time span in 10 &gt; z &gt; 7), assuming the radiation-regulated accretion model by Park &amp; Ricotti (2013). We find that, within the limits of our model, BH seeds cannot grow by more than 30 percent, suggesting that accretion on light-seed models are inadequate to explain high-z SMBH. We also compute the X-ray emission from such accreting stellar BH population in the (0.5, 8) keV band and find it comparable to the one produced by high-mass X-ray binaries. This study suggests that early BHs, by X-ray pre-heating of the intergalactic medium at cosmic dawn, might leave a specific signature on the HI 21 cm line power spectrum potentially detectable with SKA.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 11 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05760","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T22:09:45Z","registered":"2022-03-01T22:09:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T22:09:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this approach, one of important features is the appearance of an upper bound on the comoving momentum $k$, at which the stringy spacetime uncertainty relation is saturated. As a result, the time-dependent upper bound leads us to choose naturally a set of initial vacua for each mode, in which the stringy uncertainty relation is saturated. In this note, with that set of vacua we calculate power spectrum of curvature fluctuation for a power law inflation, up to the leading order of a parameter describing the spacetime noncommutativity. It turns out that this choice of initial vacuum has a significant effect on the power spectrum of fluctuations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Latex, 13 pages, v2: minor changes, two references added, to appear in PLB","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0403134","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T16:43:46Z","registered":"2022-03-18T16:43:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T16:43:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This paper-based sensor provides a promising platform with attractive advantages such as simple fabrication, intense colors, fast naked-eye response, and high specificity toward Cl$^-$ detection. The sensor undergoes a color change from yellow-orange to chestnut-brown in the presence of water and turns to green-brown in the presence of Cl$^-$. A good linear relationship ($R^2$=0.9754) between logarithmic Cl$^-$ concentration and the extinction intensity difference at 515 nm was observed at concentrations in the 20-400 mM range with a limit of detection (LOD) of 14 mM, far beyond the usual concentrations at which most of the Cl$^-$ colorimetric sensors are limited. It was also proposed a sensing mechanism based on the oxidative etching of anisotropic silver nanoparticles (from 20 to 250 nm) by Cl$^-$ and subsequent formation of chain-like aggregates, resulting in strong interparticle plasmonic coupling. This paper-based sensor can distinguish Cl$^-$ from other ions such as F$^{-}$, OH$^{-}$, NO$_{3}^{-}$, SO$_{4}^{2-}$, HPO$_{4}^{2-}$, H$_{2}$PO$_{4}^{-}$, H$^{+}$, K$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, NH$_{4}^{+}$, Zn$^{2+}$, and Co$^{2+}$ and from mixtures of these ions. The nanosensor was also tested to recognize Cl$^{-}$ in seawater and a commercial electrolyte solution, even using volumes as small as 4 $\u03bc$L, suggesting its easy inclusion in portable devices. This novel colorimetric platform is undoubtedly useful for recognizing Cl$^-$ in environmental and physiological systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04337","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2025-02-10T02:41:23Z","registered":"2025-02-10T02:41:24Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-02-10T02:41:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

There is a strong interference between these two electrons, originating from the spatial phase coherence in the normal metal at a mesoscopic length scale and the intrinsic coherence of the superconductor. We evaluated the interference effect on the transport through an NS junction. We propose the layouts to observe drastic Aharonov-Bohm and Josephson effects.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages REVTex, [PostScript] figures upon request","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9302035","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T00:47:00Z","registered":"2022-03-21T00:47:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T00:47:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture initially developed to solve general-purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and has subsequently been adapted in many fields, including healthcare. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of how this architecture has been adopted to analyze various forms of data, including medical imaging, structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, physiological signals, and biomolecular sequences. Those models could help in clinical diagnosis, report generation, data reconstruction, and drug/protein synthesis. We identified relevant studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of using transformers in healthcare and examine issues such as computational cost, model interpretability, fairness, alignment with human values, ethical implications, and environmental impact.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00067","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-07-04T01:50:28Z","registered":"2023-07-04T01:50:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-11-25T02:52:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We find the intrinsic X-ray spectra are well modelled by disc blackbody emission, its upscattering by hot electrons with a hybrid distribution, and by Compton reflection. These spectra are strongly modified by absorption and reprocessing in the stellar wind, which we model using the photoionization code cloudy. The form of the observed spectra implies the wind is composed of two phases. A hot tenuous plasma containing most of the wind mass is required to account for the observed features of very strongly ionized Fe. Small dense cool clumps filling &lt;0.01 of the volume are required to absorb the soft X-ray excess, which is emitted by the hot phase but not present in the data. The total mass-loss rate is found to be (0.6--1.6) x 10^-5 solar masses per year. We also discuss the feasibility of the continuum model dominated by Compton reflection, which we find to best describe our data. The intrinsic luminosities of our models suggest that the compact object is a black hole.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"MNRAS, in press","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5591","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T05:40:57Z","registered":"2022-03-21T05:40:58Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T05:40:58Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}
