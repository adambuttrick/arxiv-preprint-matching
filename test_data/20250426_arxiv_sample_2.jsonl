The basic result is that the character of the stellar halo velocity ellipsoid changes markedly from radial anisotropy at the sun to tangential anisotropy in the outer parts of the Galactic halo (r greater than approx 20 kpc). Specifically, the radial component of the stellar halo's velocity ellipsoid decreases fairly rapidly beyond the solar circle, from approx 140 +/- 10 km/s at the sun, to an asymptotic value of 89 +/- 19 km/s at large r. The rapid decrease in the radial velocity dispersion is matched by an increase in the tangential velocity dispersion, with increasing r. Our results may indicate that the Galaxy formed hierarchically (partly or fully) through merging of smaller subsystems - the 'bottom-up' galaxy formation scenario, which for quite a while has been favoured by most theorists and recently also has been given some observational credibility by HST observations of a potential group of small galaxies, at high redshift, possibly in the process of merging to a larger galaxy (Pascarelle et al 1996).","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Latex, 16 pages. 2 postscript figures.

Motor fluctuations are alterations between periods with a positive response to levodopa therapy (\"on\") and periods marked by re-emergency of PD symptoms (\"off\") as the response to medication wears off. These fluctuations often affect gait speed and they increase in their disabling impact as PD progresses. To improve the effectiveness of current indoor localisation methods, a transformer-based approach utilising dual modalities which provide complementary views of movement, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and accelerometer data from wearable devices, is proposed. A sub-objective aims to evaluate whether indoor localisation, including its in-home gait speed features (i.e. the time taken to walk between rooms), could be used to evaluate motor fluctuations by detecting whether the person with PD is taking levodopa medications or withholding them. To properly evaluate our proposed method, we use a free-living dataset where the movements and mobility are greatly varied and unstructured as expected in real-world conditions. 24 participants lived in pairs (consisting of one person with PD, one control) for five days in a smart home with various sensors. Our evaluation on the resulting dataset demonstrates that our proposed network outperforms other methods for indoor localisation. The sub-objective evaluation shows that precise room-level localisation predictions, transformed into in-home gait speed features, produce accurate predictions on whether the PD participant is taking or withholding their medications.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02419","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-08-07T01:05:30Z","registered":"2023-08-07T01:05:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-08-07T01:05:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the vicinity of the compensation composition in Mn-Pt-Ga, a giant exchange bias (EB) of more than 3 T and a similarly large coercivity are established. The large exchange anisotropy originates from the exchange interaction between the compensated host and ferrimagnetic clusters that arise from intrinsic anti-site disorder. We demonstrate the applicability of our design concept on a second material, Mn-Fe-Ga, with a magnetic transition above room temperature, exemplifying the universality of the concept and the feasibility of room-temperature applications. Our study points to a new direction for novel magneto-electronic devices.

The B quark is assumed to be pair produced and to decay in one of three ways: to tW, bZ, or bH. The search is carried out in final states with one, two, and more than two charged leptons, as well as in fully hadronic final states. Each of the channels in the exclusive final-state topologies is designed to be sensitive to specific combinations of the B quark-antiquark pair decays. The observed event yields are found to be consistent with the standard model expectations in all the final states studied. A statistical combination of these results is performed and upper limits are set on the cross section of the strongly produced B quark-antiquark pairs as a function of the B quark mass. Lower limits on the B quark mass between 740 and 900 GeV are set at a 95% confidence level, depending on the values of the branching fractions of the B quark to tW, bZ, and bH.

Recent experiments in monolayer and bilayer graphene have reported signatures of such hydrodynamic electron behavior in ultra-clean devices. In this theoretical work, starting from a microscopic treatment of electron-electron, electron-phonon and electron-impurity interactions within the Random Phase Approximation, we demonstrate that monolayer and bilayer graphene both host two different hydrodynamic regimes. We predict that the hydrodynamic window in bilayer graphene is stronger than in monolayer graphene, and has a characteristic `v-shape' as opposed to a `lung-shape'. Finally, we collapse experimental data onto a universal disorder-limited theory, thereby proving that the observed violation of Wiedemann-Franz law in monolayers occurs in a regime dominated by impurity-induced electron-hole puddles.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10272","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T21:50:56Z","registered":"2022-03-03T21:50:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T21:50:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Specifically, we analyze prominent Finnish World War II photographers, who have captured high numbers of photographs in the publicly available Finnish Wartime Photograph Archive, which contains 160,000 photographs from Finnish Winter, Continuation, and Lapland Wars captures in 1939-1945. We were able to find some special characteristics for different photographers in terms of their typical photo content and framing (e.g., close-ups vs. overall shots, number of people). Furthermore, we managed to train a neural network that can successfully recognize the photographer from some of the photos, which shows that such photos are indeed characteristic for certain photographers. We further analyzed the similarities and differences between the photographers using the features extracted from the photographer classifier network. We make our annotations and analysis pipeline publicly available, in an effort to introduce this new research problem to the machine learning and computer vision communities and facilitate future research in historical and societal studies over the photo archives.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09811","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T14:23:46Z","registered":"2022-02-28T14:23:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T14:23:48Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In contrast to modeling- or search-focused approaches, pARam supports customization through embodied and practical inputs (e.g., gestures, recommendations) and evaluation (e.g., lighting estimation) without demanding complex 3D-modeling skills. We implemented pARam for HoloLens 2 and evaluated it (n=20), comparing XR and desktop conditions.

We find that there are approximately five times as many satellite galaxies at this high resolution compared to a standard ($m_b\\sim 10^{4-5}\\, \\rm M_{\\odot}$) resolution simulation of the same system. This is primarily because 2/3rds of the high resolution satellites do not form at standard resolution. A smaller fraction (1/6th) of the satellites present at high resolution form and disrupt at standard resolution; these objects are preferentially low-mass satellites on intermediate- to low-eccentricity orbits with impact parameters $\\lesssim 30$ kpc. As a result, the radial distribution of satellites becomes substantially more centrally concentrated at higher resolution, in better agreement with recent observations of satellites around Milky Way-mass haloes. Finally, we show that our galaxy formation model successfully forms ultra-faint galaxies and reproduces the stellar velocity dispersion, half-light radii, and $V$-band luminosities of observed Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies across 6 orders of magnitude in luminosity ($10^3$-$10^{9}$ $\\rm L_{\\odot}$).","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted for publication in MNRAS.

Here, we exploit nanofocused scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy to quantitatively measure crystal deformation from defects in diamond with high spatial and strain resolution. Combining information from multiple Bragg angles allows stereoscopic three-dimensional modeling of strain feature geometry; the diffraction results are validated via comparison to optical measurements of the strain tensor based on spin-state-dependent spectroscopy of ensembles of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in the diamond.

Despite their large mass-loss rates and high wind velocities, none of them display a bow shock, although a fraction of them are classified as runaway. Our 2.5-D numerical simulations of circumstellar matter around a 60Mo runaway star show that the fast Wolf-Rayet stellar wind is released into a wind-blown cavity filled with various shocks and discontinuities generated throughout the precedent evolutionary phases. The resulting fast-wind slow-wind interaction leads to the formation of spherical shells of swept-up dusty material similar to those observed in near infrared 24 micron with Spitzer, and which appear to be co-moving with the runaway massive stars, regardless of their proper motion and/or the properties of the local ambient medium. We interpret bright infrared rings around runaway Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galactic plane, like WR138a, as indication of their very high initial masses and a complex evolutionary history. Stellar-wind bow shocks become faint as stars run in diluted media, therefore, our results explain the absence of detected bow shocks around Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars such as the high-latitude, very fast-moving objects WR71, WR124 and WR148. Our results show that the absence of a bow shock is consistent with a runaway nature of some Wolf-Rayet stars. This questions the in-situ star formation scenario of high-latitude Wolf-Rayet stars in favor of dynamical ejection from birth sites in the Galactic plane.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, accepted to MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06027","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T18:55:35Z","registered":"2022-02-24T18:55:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T18:55:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The interaction between dark energy and dark matter is reconsidered. The interaction term $Q=bH_0\u03c1_{\\rm de}^\u03b1\u03c1_{\\rm dm}^{1-\u03b1}$ is adopted, which abandons the Hubble expansion rate $H$ and involves both $\u03c1_{\\rm de}$ and $\u03c1_{\\rm dm}$. Moreover, the new initial condition for the agegraphic dark energy is used, which solves the problem of accommodating baryon matter and radiation in the model. The solution of the model can be given using an iterative algorithm. A concrete example for the calculation of the model is given. Furthermore, the model is constrained by using the combined Planck data (Planck+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$) and the combined WMAP-9 data (WMAP+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$). Three typical cases are considered: (A) $Q=bH_0\u03c1_{\\rm de}$, (B) $Q=bH_0\\sqrt{\u03c1_{\\rm de}\u03c1_{\\rm dm}}$, and (C) $Q=bH_0\u03c1_{\\rm dm}$, which correspond to $\u03b1=1$, 1/2, and 0, respectively. The departures of the models from the $\u039b$CDM model are measured by the $\u0394$BIC and $\u0394$AIC values. It is shown that the INADE model is better than the NADE model in the fit, and the INADE(A) model is the best in fitting data among the three cases.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 2 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1289","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T07:28:34Z","registered":"2022-03-21T07:28:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T07:28:35Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Using the generic hierarchical ansatz and the lognormal approximation we derive the analytical expressions for the one-point PDF as well as for the joint two-point probability distribution (2PDF) of transmitted fluxes in two neighbouring QSOs. These flux PDFs are constructed in 3D as well as in projection (i.e. in 2D). The PDFs are constructed by relating the lower-order moments, i.e. cumulants and cumulant correlators, of the fluxes to the 3D neutral hydrogen distribution which is, in turn, expressed as a function of the underlying dark matter distribution. The lower-order moments are next modelled using a generating function formalism in the context of a {\\em minimal tree-model} for the higher-order correlation hierarchy. These different approximations give nearly identical results for the range of redshifts probed, and we also find a very good agreement between our predictions and outputs of hydrodynamical simulations. The formalism developed here for the joint statistics of flux-decrements concerning two lines of sight can be extended to multiple lines of sight, which could be particularly important for the 3D reconstruction of the cosmic web from QSO spectra (e.g. in the BOSS survey). These statistics probe the underlying projected neutral hydrogen field and are thus linked to \"hot-spots\" of absorption. The results for the PDF and the bias presented here use the same functional forms of scaling functions that have previously been employed for the modelling of other cosmological observation such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 8 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4334","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T22:01:43Z","registered":"2022-03-12T22:01:44Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T22:01:44Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To address this problem, this work proposes an online hash model to accommodate data coming in stream for online learning. Specifically, a new loss function is proposed to measure the similarity loss between a pair of data samples in hamming space. Then, a structured hash model is derived and optimized in a passive-aggressive way. Theoretical analysis on the upper bound of the cumulative loss for the proposed online hash model is provided. Furthermore, we extend our online hashing from a single-model to a multi-model online hashing that trains multiple models so as to retain diverse online hashing models in order to avoid biased update. The competitive efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed online hash models are verified through extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets as compared to related hashing methods.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"To appear in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2689242)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01897","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T16:18:04Z","registered":"2022-03-04T16:18:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T16:18:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this paper, we develop a new subgrid model for the turbulent dynamo that takes place in the supersonic interstellar medium in star-forming galaxies. It is based on a mean-field approach that computes the turbulent kinetic energy at unresolved scales (the so-called subgrid scales) and modifies the induction equation to account for the corresponding $\u03b1$ dynamo. Our subgrid model depends on one free parameter, the quenching parameter, that controls the saturation of the subgrid dynamo. Thanks to this mean-field approach, we can now model the fast amplification of the magnetic field inside turbulent star-forming galaxies, without relying on artificially strong initial fields or without using prohibitively expensive high-resolution simulations. We show that the evolution of the magnetic field in our zoom-in Milky Way-like galaxy is consistent with a simple picture, in which the field is in equipartition with the turbulent kinetic energy inside the star-forming disc, with a field strength around 10 $\u03bc$G at low redshift, while at the same time strong galactic outflows fill the halo with a slightly weaker magnetic field, whose strength (10 nG) is consistent will the ideal MHD dilution factor. Our results are in good agreement with recent theoretical and numerical predictions. We also compare our simulation with Faraday depth observations at both low and high redshift, seeing overall good agreement with some caveats. Our model naturally predicts stronger magnetic fields at high redshift (around 100 $\u03bc$G in the galaxy and 1 $\u03bc$G in the halo), but also stronger depolarisation effects due to stronger turbulence at early time.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14246","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T12:38:43Z","registered":"2022-02-21T12:38:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-05-13T01:16:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In particular, the variability of indicators relevant to social and economic well-being between localized populations is of great interest, as it pertains to the spatial manifestations of inequality and segregation. However, heterogeneity in population density, sensitivity of statistical analyses to spatial aggregation, and the importance of pre-drawn political boundaries for policy intervention may decrease the efficacy and relevance of existing methods for analyzing spatial socioeconomic data. Additionally, these measures commonly lack either a framework for comparing results for qualitative and quantitative data on the same scale, or a mechanism for generalization to multi-region correlations. To mitigate these issues associated with traditional spatial measures, here we view local deviations in socioeconomic variables from a topological lens rather than a spatial one, and use a novel information theoretic network approach based on the Generalized Jensen Shannon Divergence to distinguish distributional quantities across adjacent regions. We apply our methodology in a series of experiments to study the network of neighboring census tracts in the continental US, quantifying the decay in two-point distributional correlations across the network, examining the county-level socioeconomic disparities induced from the aggregation of tracts, and constructing an algorithm for the division of a city into homogeneous clusters. These results provide a new framework for analyzing the variation of attributes across regional populations, and shed light on new, universal patterns in socioeconomic attributes.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13825","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T08:40:40Z","registered":"2022-02-24T08:40:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T08:40:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) discharges excited using non-sinusoidal waveform have shown its capability to control IEDF through generation of DC self-bias. In this paper, we performed a particle-in-cell simulation study to investigate the IEDF in a symmetric capacitive discharge excited by saw-tooth like current waveform at a very high frequency (VHF). At a constant driving frequency of 27.12 MHz, the simulation results predict that the ion energy symmetry scales with the discharge current amplitude and the IEDF turn into a bi-modal distribution at higher current density amplitude. Further studies at a constant current density and varying the fundamental excitation frequency, shows that the ion energy asymmetry is greatly reduced with a reduction in the driving frequency. Increase in the plasma asymmetry and significant DC self-bias at lower driving frequency is observed to be one of the principal factors responsible for the observed asymmetry in the ion energy peaks. An investigation of DC self-bias and plasma potential confirm that the powered electrode energy peak corresponds to the DC self-bias with respect to the plasma potential, and the grounded electrode peak corresponds to the plasma potential. These results suggest that although lower frequency is good for generating the asymmetry and DC self-bias in the discharge, but a narrow low energy IEDF is only possible in very high frequency driven CCP systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14847","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T09:54:09Z","registered":"2022-02-23T09:54:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-06-21T03:41:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This extends previous work in which the same problem has been addressed for pure spin Hamiltonians. As a main result, we show that the relaxation dynamics of the double occupancy and of the staggered moment are different. The former is controlled by the nearest-neighbor tunneling rate while the latter is much slower and strongly dependent on the interaction strength, indicating that spin excitations are important. This difference in characteristic energy scales for the fast charge dynamics and the much slower spin dynamics is also reflected in the real-time evolution of nearest-neighbor density and spin correlations. A very interesting time dependence emerges in the von Neumann entropy, which at short times increases linearly with a slope proportional to the tunneling matrix element while the long-time growth of entanglement is controlled by spin excitations. Our predictions for the different relaxation dynamics of the staggered moment and the double occupancy should be observable in state-of-the art optical lattice experiments.

While major mergers are quite rare at present, minor mergers and satellite disruptions - which result in stellar streams - should be common, and are indeed seen in both the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. As a pilot study, we have carried out ultra-deep, wide-field imaging of some spiral galaxies in the Local Volume, which has revealed external views of such stellar tidal streams at unprecedented detail, with data taken at small robotic telescopes (0.1-0.5-meter) that provide exquisite surface brightness sensitivity. The goal of this project is to undertake the first systematic and comprehensive imaging survey of stellar tidal streams, from a sample of ~50 nearby Milky-Way-like spiral galaxies within 15 Mpc, that features a surface brightness sensitivity of ~ 30 mag/arcsec^2 The survey will result in estimates of the incidence, size/geometry and stellar luminosity/mass distribution of such streams. This will not only put our Milky Way and M31 in context but, for the first time, also provide an extensive statistical basis for comparison with state-of-the-art, self-consistent cosmological simulations of this phenomenon.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Invited talk in \"Hightlights of Spanish Astrophysics V\", Proceedings of the VIII Scientific Meeting of the Spanish Astronomical Society (SEA), Springer, 8 pages.

Recent experiments under such loading have found this to be accompanied by a striking dip in the segmental relaxation time. This can be explained by a minimal nonfactorable model combining flow-induced melting of a glass with the buildup of stress carried by strained polymers. Within this model, liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong flow that creates polymer-borne stress, slowing the deformation enough for the segmental (or solvent) modes to then re-vitrify. Here we present new results for the corresponding behavior under step-stress shear loading, to which very similar physics applies. To explain the unloading behavior in the extensional case requires introduction of a crinkle factor describing a rapid loss of segmental ordering. We discuss in more detail here the physics of this, which we argue involves non-entropic contributions to the polymer stress, and which might lead to some important differences between shear and elongation. We also discuss some fundamental and possibly testable issues concerning the physical meaning of entropic elasticity in vitrified polymers. Finally we present new results for the startup of steady shear flow, addressing the possible role of transient shear banding.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0929","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T17:44:59Z","registered":"2022-03-11T17:45:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T17:45:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This behavior is explicitly analyzed for realistic $F(R)$ models, in particular, exponential gravity and a power form model. To stabilize such oscillations, we consider the additional modification of the models via a correction term which does not destroy the viability properties. A detailed analysis on the future evolution of the universe and the evolution history of the growth index of the matter density perturbations are performed. Furthermore, we explore two applications of exponential gravity to the inflationary scenario. We show how it is possible to obtain different numbers of $e$-folds during the early-time acceleration by making different choices of the model parameters in the presence of ultrarelativistic matter, which destabilizes inflation and eventually leads to the exit from the inflationary stage. We execute the numerical analysis of inflation in two viable exponential gravity models. It is proved that at the end of the inflation, the effective energy density and curvature of the universe decrease and thus a unified description between inflation and the $\u039b$CDM-like dark energy dominated era can be realized.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"35 pages, 23 figures, version accepted for publication in Classical and Quantum Gravity","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1009","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T23:55:37Z","registered":"2022-03-11T23:55:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T23:55:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This leads to an infinite hierarchy of local tangent space symmetries, which are connected to the super-Maxwell$_\\infty$ algebra. A novel feature of type II is the Ramond-Ramond sector, which can be encoded as an orthosymplectic spinor (encoding the complex of super p-forms in conventional superspace). Its covariant field strength bispinor itself appears as a piece of the supervielbein. We provide a concise discussion of the superspace Bianchi identities through dimension two and show how to recover the component supersymmetry transformations of type II DFT.

Several quantum algorithms have been proposed to determine the singular values and their associated singular vectors of a given matrix.

In this work, we propose a variational quantum algorithm for singular value decomposition (VQSVD). By exploiting the variational principles for singular values and the Ky Fan Theorem, we design a novel loss function such that two quantum neural networks (or parameterized quantum circuits) could be trained to learn the singular vectors and output the corresponding singular values. Furthermore, we conduct numerical simulations of VQSVD for random matrices as well as its applications in image compression of handwritten digits.

It has three gain modes (high, medium and low) and two auto-ranging modes (high-to-low and medium-to-low). The first ePix10K cameras are built around modules consisting of a sensor flip-chip bonded to 4 ASICs, resulting in 352x384 pixels of 100 $\u03bc$m x 100 $\u03bc$m each. We present results from extensive testing of three ePix10K cameras with FEL beams at LCLS, resulting in a measured noise floor of 245 eV rms, or 67 e$^-$ equivalent noise charge (ENC), and a range of 11000 photons at 8 keV. We demonstrate the linearity of the response in various gain combinations: fixed high, fixed medium, fixed low, auto-ranging high to low, and auto-ranging medium-to-low, while maintaining a low noise (well within the counting statistics), a very low cross-talk, perfect saturation response at fluxes up to 900 times the maximum range, and acquisition rates of up to 480 Hz. Finally, we present examples of high dynamic range x-ray imaging spanning more than 4 orders of magnitude dynamic range (from a single photon to 11000 photons/pixel/pulse at 8 keV). Achieving this high performance with only one auto-ranging switch leads to relatively simple calibration and reconstruction procedures. The low noise levels allow usage with long integration times at non-FEL sources. ePix10K cameras leverage the advantages of hybrid pixel detectors with high production yield and good availability, minimize development complexity through sharing the hardware, software and DAQ development with all other versions of ePix cameras, while providing an upgrade path to 5 kHz, 25 kHz and 100 kHz in three steps over the next few years, matching the LCLS-II requirements.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06805","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T09:54:09Z","registered":"2022-02-28T09:54:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T09:54:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We observed H3+ emission from Saturn's northern and southern auroral regions, simultaneously, over the course of more than two hours, obtaining spectral images along the central meridian as Saturn rotates. Previous ground-based work has derived only an average temperature of an individual polar region, summing an entire night of observations. Here we analyse 20 H3+ spectra, 10 for each hemisphere, providing H3+ temperature, column density and total emission in both the northern and southern polar regions simultaneously, improving on past results in temporal cadence and simultaneity. We find that: 1) the average thermospheric temperatures are 527+/-18 K in northern Spring and 583+/-13 K in southern Autumn, respectively; 2) this asymmetry in temperature is likely to be the result of an inversely proportional relationship between the total thermospheric heating rate (Joule heating and ion drag) and magnetic field strength - i.e. the larger northern field strength leads to reduced total heating rate and a reduced temperature, irrespective of season, and 3) this implies that thermospheric heating and temperatures are relatively insensitive to seasonal effects.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages (single column), 4 figures, 1 table.

In our stochastic Kohn-Sham DFT method, the density is an average over multiple stochastic samples, with stochastic errors that decrease as the inverse square root of the number of sampling orbitals. Here we develop a stochastic embedding density functional theory method (se-DFT) that selectively reduces the stochastic error (specifically on the forces) for a selected sub-system(s). The motivation, similar to that of other quantum embedding methods, is that for many systems of practical interest the properties are often determined by only a small sub-system. In stochastic embedding DFT two sets of orbitals are used: a deterministic one associated with the embedded subspace, and the rest which is described by a stochastic set. The method is exact in the limit of large number of stochastic samples. We apply se-DFT to study a p-nitroaniline molecule in water, where the statistical errors in the forces on the system (the p-nitroaniline molecule) are reduced by an order of magnitude compared with non-embedding stochastic DFT.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07099","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T22:49:07Z","registered":"2022-02-27T22:49:09Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T22:49:09Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Gaia is providing an exhaustive census of stellar parallaxes, proper motions, positions, colors and radial velocities, but also leaves some flaring holes in an otherwise complete data set. The radial velocities measured with the on-board high-resolution spectrograph will only reach some 10% of the full sample of stars with astrometry and photometry from the mission, and detailed chemical information will be obtained for less than 1%. Teams all over the world are organizing large-scale projects to provide complementary radial velocities and chemistry, since this can now be done very efficiently from the ground thanks to large and mid-size telescopes with a wide field-of-view and multi-object spectrographs. As a result, automated data processing is taking an ever increasing relevance, and the concept is applying to many more areas, from targeting to analysis.

Finite inflation leads to oscillations and a cutoff towards large scales in the primordial power spectrum and curvature pushes them into the CMB observable window. Using nested sampling, we carry out Bayesian parameter estimations and model comparisons taking into account constraints from reheating and horizon considerations. We confirm the preference of CMB data for closed universes with Bayesian odds of over $100:1$ and with a posterior on the curvature density parameter of $\u03a9_{K,0}=-0.051\\pm0.017$ for a curvature extension of LCDM and $\u03a9_{K,0}=-0.031\\pm0.014$ for Starobinsky inflation.

Previous work at ~1 kpc resolution has already revealed common features in the mass buildup (e.g., inside-out growth of galaxies). However, even at approximate kpc scales, the stellar populations are blurred between the different galactic morphological structures such as spiral arms, bars and bulges. Here we present a detailed analysis of the spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) of 19 PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, at a spatial resolution of ~100 pc. We show that our sample of local galaxies exhibits predominantly negative radial gradients of stellar age and [Z/H], consistent with previous findings, and a radial structure that is primarily consistent with local star formation, and indicative of inside-out formation. In barred galaxies, we find flatter [Z/H] gradients along the semi-major axis of the bar than along the semi-minor axis, as is expected from the radial mixing of material along the bar. In general, the derived assembly histories of the galaxies in our sample tell a consistent story of inside-out growth, where low-mass galaxies assembled the majority of their stellar mass later in cosmic history than high-mass galaxies. We also show how stellar populations of different ages exhibit different kinematics, with younger stellar populations having lower velocity dispersions than older stellar populations at similar galactocentric distances, which we interpret as an imprint of the progressive dynamical heating of stellar populations as they age. Finally, we explore how the time-averaged star formation rate evolves with time, and how it varies across galactic disks. This analysis reveals a wide variation of the SFHs of galaxy centers and additionally shows that structural features become less pronounced with age.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"52 pages, 48 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13676","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-03-27T00:48:41Z","registered":"2023-03-27T00:48:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-05-25T01:36:53Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These signals arise from the photosphere of the stars. The m/s perturbation created by these signals prevents the detection and mass characterization of small-mass planetary candidates such as Earth-twins. Several methods have been proposed to mitigate stellar signals in RV measurements. However, without precisely knowing the stellar and planetary signals in real observations, it is extremely difficult to test the efficiency of these methods. The goal of the RV fitting challenge is to generate simulated RV data including stellar and planetary signals and to perform a blind test within the community to test the efficiency of the different methods proposed to recover planetary signals despite stellar signals. In this first paper, we describe the simulation used to model the measurements of the RV fitting challenge. Each simulated planetary system includes the signals from instrumental noise, stellar oscillations, granulation, supergranulation, stellar activity, and observed and simulated planetary systems. In addition to RV variations, this simulation also models the effects of instrumental noise and stellar signals on activity observables obtained by HARPS-type high-resolution spectrographs, that is, the calcium activity index log(R'hk) and the bisector span and full width at half maximum of the cross-correlation function.

The family of efficient measurements varies with the choice of the disturbance measure. On the other hand, commutativity between the elements of the probability operator-valued measure (POVM) and the equilibrium state of the thermometer is a necessary condition for efficiency with respect to any figure of disturbance.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 10 figures, close to published version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00972","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T23:46:59Z","registered":"2022-03-02T23:47:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T23:47:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The electronic band structure of a kagome lattice can host both flat bands as well as Dirac-like bands, offering the possibility to stabilize various quantum states. Here, we probe the band structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ via Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations on both bulk single crystals and thin flakes. Although our frequency spectra are broadly consistent with the published data, we unambiguously reveal the existence of new frequencies with large frequencies ranging from $\\sim$2085~T to $\\sim$2717~T in thin flakes when the magnetic field is along the $c$-axis. These quasi-two-dimensional frequencies correspond to $\\sim$52\\% to 67\\% of the CDW-distorted Brillouin zone volume. The Lifshitz-Kosevich analysis further uncovers surprisingly small cyclotron effective masses, of the order of $\\sim$0.1~$m_e$, for these frequencies. Consequently, a large number of high-velocity carriers exists in the thin flake of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Comparing with our band structure calculations, we argue that an orbital-selective modification of the band structure is active. Our results provide indispensable information for understanding the fermiology of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, paving a way for understanding how an orbital-selective mechanism can become an effective means to tune its electronic properties.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 figures.

By comparing these data with simulated results based on the behavior of X-ray binaries, we find possible similarities in spectral indices below 1% Eddington ratio. We further investigate the Eddington ratios of changing-look quasars before and after their spectral type changes, and find that changing-look quasars cross the 1% Eddington ratio boundary when their broad emission lines disappear/emerge. This is consistent with the disk-wind model as the origin of broad emission lines.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02245","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-22T02:18:11Z","registered":"2022-02-22T02:18:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-22T02:18:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Stochastic approaches provide a gentler system-size dependency at the cost of introducing \"noisy\" forces, which serve to limit the efficiency of the sampling. In the first-order Langevin dynamics (FOLD), efficient sampling is achievable by combining a well-chosen preconditioning matrix S with a time-step-bias-mitigating propagator (Mazzola et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 118, 015703 (2017)). However, when forces are noisy, S is set equal to the force-covariance matrix, a procedure which severely limits the efficiency and the stability of the sampling. Here, we develop a new, general, optimal, and stable sampling approach for FOLD under noisy forces. We apply it for silicon nanocrystals treated with stochastic density functional theory and show efficiency improvements by an order-of-magnitude.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.12002","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T00:22:37Z","registered":"2022-02-27T00:22:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T00:22:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A long-range ordered FIM phase has been predicted in related materials, but without symmetry analysis. We now perform this analysis and use it to calculate the MOKE spectra in AFM and FIM phases. From the good agreement between the form of the measured and predicted MOKE spectra, we propose the AFM and FIM phases share the magnetic space group C2'/m' and that the symmetry driven magneto-optic and magneto-transport properties are maximised at room temperature in the FIM phase due to the non-zero intrinsic Berry phase contribution present in these materials. A room temperature FIM phase with large optical and transport signatures, as well as sensitivity to lattice strain and magnetic field, has useful prospects for high-speed spintronic applications.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"21 pages 4 figures 1 table 4 supplementary figures 1 supplementary table Co-first author: F.

By cross-matching with LAMOST DR6, we have determined 7 and 50 Non-Blazhko RRab stars in the Kepler and K2 fields, respectively, who have homogeneous metallicities determined from low-resolution spectra of the LAMOST-Kepler/K2 project. The Fourier Decomposition method is applied to the light curves of these stars provided by the Kepler space based telescope to determine the fundamental pulsation periods and the pulsation parameters. The calculated amplitude ratios of R21, R31 and the phase differences of \u03d521, \u03d531 are consistent with the parameters of the RRab stars in both the Globular Clusters and the Large Magellanic Cloud. We find a linear relationship between the phase differences \u03d521 and \u03d531, which is in good agreement with the results in previous literature. As far as the amplitude, we find that the amplitude of primary frequency A1 and the total amplitude Atot follow either a cubic or linear relationship. For the rise time RT, we do not find its relevance with the period of the fundamental pulsation mode P1, or Atot and \u03d521. However, it might follow a linear relationship with R31. Based on the homogeneous metallicities, we have derived a new calibration formula for the relationship of period-\u03d531-[Fe/H], which agrees well with the previous studies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05782","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-03-13T00:49:30Z","registered":"2023-03-13T00:49:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-03-13T00:49:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Using archival Chandra and Suzaku observations, we have carried out a spectro-timing analysis of the source during three different epochs. We compare the average orbital profile and obtain differences in pre-eclipse dip morphologies between different observation epochs. We observe an orbit to orbit evolution of the dips for the first time in this source in both the Chandra observations, reflecting changes in the structure of the accretion disc in timescales of hours. We further perform intensity resolved spectroscopy for both the Chandra and the Suzaku data to characterize the changes in the spectral parameters from the persistent to the dipping intervals. We find that the absorbers responsible for the dips, can be best described using a partially ionized partial covering absorber, with an ionization parameter, log($\u03be$) of $\\sim$2.

Nevertheless, bulk compounds are scarce, hindering a full understanding of the role of chemical pressure or strain on lattice distortions that in turn could alter magnetic and electronic properties of the 2D nickelates. Here, by performing a full analysis of the prototypical YNiO$_2$ compound with first-principles simulations, we identify that these materials are prone to exhibit O$_4$ group rotations whose type and amplitude are governed by the usual R-to-Ni cation size mismatch. We further show that these rotations can be easily tuned by external stimuli modifying lattice parameters such as pressure or strain.

An important, and so far overlooked, aspect of reality is the diverse strategic identities of individuals. While applying the same strategy to all interaction partners may be an acceptable assumption for simpler forms of life, this fails to account} for the behavior of more complex living beings. For instance, we humans act differently around different people. Here we show that allowing individuals to adopt different strategies with different partners yields a very rich evolutionary dynamics, including time-dependent coexistence of cooperation and defection, system-wide shifts in the dominant strategy, and maturation in individual choices. Our results are robust to variations in network type and size, and strategy updating rules. Accounting for diverse strategic identities thus has far-reaching implications in the mathematical modeling of social games.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09798","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T21:39:53Z","registered":"2022-02-24T21:39:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T21:39:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The first part of this paper focusses on issues pertaining to dark matter including observational evidence for its existence, current constraints and the `abundance of substructure' and `cuspy core' issues which arise in CDM. I also briefly describe MOND. The second part of this review focusses on dark energy. In this part I discuss the significance of the cosmological constant problem which leads to a predicted value of the cosmological constant which is almost $10^{123}$ times larger than the observed value $\\la/8\u03c0G \\simeq 10^{-47}$GeV$^4$. Setting $\\la$ to this small value ensures that the acceleration of the universe is a fairly recent phenomenon giving rise to the `cosmic coincidence' conundrum according to which we live during a special epoch when the density in matter and $\\la$ are almost equal. Anthropic arguments are briefly discussed but more emphasis is placed upon dynamical dark energy models in which the equation of state is time dependent. These include Quintessence, Braneworld models, Chaplygin gas and Phantom energy. Model independent methods to determine the cosmic equation of state and the Statefinder diagnostic are also discussed. The Statefinder has the attractive property $\\atridot/a H^3 = 1 $ for LCDM, which is helpful for differentiating between LCDM and rival dark energy models. The review ends with a brief discussion of the fate of the universe in dark energy models.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"40 pages, 11 figures, Lectures presented at the Second Aegean Summer School on the Early Universe, Syros, Greece, September 2003, New References added Final version to appear in the Proceedings; typo's corrected. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0910.5406, arXiv:0808.0826, arXiv:1105.1087 by other authors","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403324","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T16:51:48Z","registered":"2022-03-18T16:51:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-07-19T02:15:13Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In these cases, instrumental effects in the image plane CCDs need to be accounted and/or corrected for in measurement algorithms. Otherwise, the systematic errors induced in the measurements might overwhelm the size of the desired effects. Lateral electric fields in the bulk of the CCDs caused by field shaping potentials or space charge build up as the electrons in the image are acquired can cause lateral deflections of the electrons drifting in the CCD bulk. Here, I report on the LSST effort to model these effects on a photon-by-photon basis by the use of a Monte Carlo technique. The eventual goal of this work is to produce a CCD model validated by laboratory data which can then be used to evaluate its effects on weak lensing science.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 6 figures.

While several theoretical works have focused on the effect of polydispersity on the bulk phase behavior of a colloidal system, little is known about the effect of a gravitational field on a polydisperse colloidal suspension. We extend here sedimentation path theory to study sedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium of a mass-polydisperse colloidal system: the particles possess different buoyant masses but they are otherwise identical. The model helps to understand the interplay between gravity and polydispersity on sedimentation experiments. Since the theory can be applied to any parent distribution of buoyant masses, it can be also used to study sedimentation of monodisperse colloidal systems. We find that mass-polydispersity has a strong influence in colloidal systems near density matching for which the bare density of the colloidal particles equals the solvent density. To illustrate the theory, we study crystallization in sedimentation-diffusion-equilibrium of a suspension of mass-polydisperse hard spheres.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04862","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-10-11T01:38:26Z","registered":"2022-10-11T01:38:26Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-12-29T02:20:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For its high nutritional value on the one hand, and because it is an adequate species for insects in controlled environmental agriculture systems, on the other. Therefore, several models describing this larvae's behaviour have been developed in the literature. Due to the complex nature of living organisms, systems of controlled environment agriculture are characterised by their strong nonlinearities. In this paper, we present a three dimensional nonlinear model describing the black soldier fly dry biomass weight dynamic changes due to the temperature's influence. In practice, this biomass weight is not measured in real time. This becomes problematic for applying feedback control strategies that assume full information of the states. Thus, this work investigates the observability of the dry biomass of a Hermetia illucens farming batch. The instantaneous and global observability of the aforementioned model is proven by constructing an injective transformation between the state space and a higher dimensional space where the transformed states are observable.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 3 figures, 2024 European Control Conference (ECC)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02395","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-08-06T02:52:28Z","registered":"2024-08-06T02:52:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-08-06T02:52:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Regular bonds and shortcuts are assigned linear springs of constant $k$ and $k'$, respectively. In our models, shortcuts can only stand extensions less than $\u03b4_c$ beyond which they are removed from the network. First we consider the simple cases of a hierarchical small-world network and a complete network. In the main part of this paper we study random small-world networks (RSWN) in which each pair of nodes is connected by a shortcut with probability $p$. We obtain a scaling relation for the effective stiffness of RSWN when $k=k'$. In this case the extension distribution of shortcuts is scale free with the exponent -2. There is a strong positive correlation between the extension of shortcuts and their betweenness. We find that the chemical end-to-end distance (CEED) could change either abruptly or continuously with respect to the external force. In the former case, the critical force is determined by the average number of shortcuts emanating from a node. In the latter case, the distribution of changes in CEED obeys power laws of the exponent $-\u03b1$ with $\u03b1\\le 3/2$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, 14 figures, 1 table, published version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0503205","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T00:35:50Z","registered":"2022-03-18T00:35:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T00:35:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The weak signature of this frustration is also noted in Ce0.8Y0.2NiGe2, whereas, it is suppressed in Ce0.6Y0.4NiGe2. Heat capacity studies on Ce0.9Y0.1NiGe2 and Ce0.8Y0.2NiGe2 indicate the presence of a new magnetic anomaly at high field which indicates that quantum criticality is absent in these compounds. However, for Ce0.6Y0.4NiGe2 such an anomaly is not noted. For this later compound, the magnetic field (H) and temperature (T) dependence of heat capacity and magnetization obey H/T scaling above critical fields. However, the obtained scaling critical parameter (\u03b4) is 1.6, which is away from mean field value of 3. This deviation suggests the presence of unusual fluctuations and anomalous quantum criticality in these compounds.

ALPs interact primarily with two photons and can generate photon-ALP oscillations in the presence of an external magnetic field. They are attracting increasing interest since photon-ALP oscillations produce deep consequences in very-high-energy (VHE) astrophysics. Two hints for the existence of an ALP have recently been proposed. In this paper, we study another effect of the photon-ALP interaction: the change of the polarization state of photons. In particular, we study the propagation of the photon-ALP beam starting where photons are produced - we consider photons generated in a galaxy cluster or in the jet of a blazar - crossing several magnetized media (blazar jet, host galaxy, galaxy cluster, extragalactic space, Milky Way) up to their arrival at the Earth. In the presence of photon-ALP interaction, we analyze the final photon survival probability $P_{\u03b3\\to \u03b3}$ and the corresponding photon degree of linear polarization $\u03a0_L$ for energies in the range $(1-10^{15}) \\, \\rm eV$. We observe that photons, which are expected as unpolarized in the absence of ALPs, are made partially polarized by photon-ALP interaction. Our findings can be tested by observatories like IXPE (already operative), and by the proposed missions eXTP, XL-Calibur, NGXP and XPP in the X-ray band and by COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO in the high-energy range. We also discover a peculiar feature in the VHE band, where photons at energies above $ \\sim (1-10) \\, \\rm TeV$ are fully polarized because of photon-ALP interaction. A possible detection of this feature would represent a proof for the existence of an ALP, but, unfortunately, current technologies do not allow yet to detect photon polarization up to so high energies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"26 pages, 20 figures, This version matches the published paper: Phys.

Simultaneously, this has created the demand for a theoretical framework able to decipher the experimental observations, shed light on the complex biomechanical processes that govern the interaction between the cell and the extracellular matrix and offer testable predictions. Contour models of cellular adhesion, represent one of the simplest and yet most insightful approach in this problem. Rooted in the paradigm of active matter, these models allow to explicitly determine the shape of the cell edge and calculate the traction forces experienced by the substrate, starting from the internal and peripheral contractile stresses as well as the passive restoring forces and bending moments arising within the actin cortex and the plasma membrane. In this chapter I provide a general overview of contour models of cellular adhesion and review the specific cases of cells equipped with isotropic and anisotropic actin cytoskeleton as well as the role of bending elasticity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"24 pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1304.1077","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11173","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T03:49:51Z","registered":"2022-02-27T03:49:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T03:49:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, hitherto the magnetic nature of bubbles cannot be verified due to the lack of on-disk photospheric magnetic field observations. Here for the first time, we find and investigate an on-disk prominence bubble around a filament barb on 2019 March 18 based on stereoscopic observations from NVST, SDO, and STEREO-A. In high-resolution NVST H$\u03b1$ images, this bubble has a sharp arch-like boundary and a projected width of $\\thicksim$26 Mm. Combining SDO and STEREO-A images, we further reconstruct 3D structure of the bubble boundary, whose maximum height is $\\thicksim$15.6 Mm. The squashing factor Q map deduced from extrapolated 3D magnetic fields around the bubble depicts a distinct arch-shaped interface with a height of $\\thicksim$11 Mm, which agrees well with the reconstructed 3D structure of the observed bubble boundary. Under the interface lies a set of magnetic loops, which is rooted on a surrounding photospheric magnetic patch. To be more persuasive, another on-disk bubble on 2019 June 10 is presented as a supplement. According to these results obtained from on-disk bubble observations, we suggest that the bubble boundary corresponds to the interface between the prominence dips (barb) and the underlying magnetic loops rooted nearby. It is thus reasonable to speculate that the bubble can form around a filament barb below which there is a photospheric magnetic patch.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 5 figures, 2 movies, accepted for publication in ApJL","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07860","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-22T06:53:56Z","registered":"2022-02-22T06:53:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-22T06:53:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The GFPP involves Prabhakar generalized Mittag-Leffler functions and contains for special choices of the parameters the Laskin fractional Poisson process, the Erlang process and the standard Poisson process. We demonstrate this by means of explicit formulas. We develop the Montroll-Weiss continuous-time random walk (CTRW) for the GFPP on undirected networks which has Prabhakar distributed waiting times between the jumps of the walker. For this walk, we derive a generalized fractional Kolmogorov-Feller equation which involves Prabhakar generalized fractional operators governing the stochastic motions on the network. We analyze in $d$ dimensions the 'well-scaled' diffusion limit and obtain a fractional diffusion equation which is of the same type as for a walk with Mittag-Leffler distributed waiting times. The GFPP has the potential to capture various aspects in the dynamics of certain complex systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"38 Pages, 4 Figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09704","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T11:07:10Z","registered":"2022-02-28T11:07:14Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T11:07:14Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Each site of the square lattice has 4 nearest-neighbour exchange bonds of strength $J_{1}$ and 2 next-nearest-neighbour (diagonal) bonds of strength $J_{2}$. The $J_{2}$ bonds are arranged so that the basic square plaquettes in alternating columns have either both or no $J_{2}$ bonds included. The classical ($s \\rightarrow \\infty$) version of the model has 4 collinear phases when $J_{1}$ and $J_{2}$ can take either sign. Three phases are antiferromagnetic (AFM), showing so-called N\u00e9el, double N\u00e9el and double columnar striped order respectively, while the fourth is ferromagnetic. For the quantum $s=1/2$ model we use the 3 classical AFM phases as CCM reference states, on top of which the multispin-flip configurations arising from quantum fluctuations are incorporated in a systematic truncation hierarchy. Calculations of the corresponding GS energy, magnetic order parameter and the susceptibilities of the states to various forms of valence-bond crystalline (VBC) order are thus carried out numerically to high orders of approximation and then extrapolated to the (exact) physical limit. We find that the $s=1/2$ model has 5 phases, which correspond to the four classical phases plus a new quantum phase with plaquette VBC order. The positions of the 5 quantum critical points are determined with high accuracy. While all 4 phase transitions in the classical model are first order, we find strong evidence that 3 of the 5 quantum phase transitions in the $s=1/2$ model are of continuous deconfined type.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4573","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T19:17:23Z","registered":"2022-03-10T19:17:24Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T19:17:24Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In particular, biological networks can display a quadratic growth in regulator number with genome size even while remaining sparsely connected. These features are mutually incompatible in standard treatments of network theory which typically require that every new network node possesses at least one connection. To model sparsely connected networks, we generalize existing approaches and add each new node with a probabilistic number of links to generate either accelerating, hyper-accelerating, or even decelerating network statistics in different regimes. Under preferential attachment for example, slowly accelerating networks display stationary scale-free statistics relatively independent of network size while more rapidly accelerating networks display a transition from scale-free to exponential statistics with network growth. Such transitions explain, for instance, the evolutionary record of single-celled organisms which display strict size and complexity limits.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 9 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0502013","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T16:41:28Z","registered":"2022-03-17T16:41:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T16:41:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Identifying voids with the VIDE toolkit, we find no statistically significant differences in the ellipticities, but find that coupling produces a population of significantly larger voids, possibly explaining the recent result of Tavasoli et al. (2013). In addition, we use the universal density profile of Hamaus et al.

In particular, we consider spin orbit coupled electronic systems of two-dimensional crystal Shastry-Sutherland lattice at integer filling where the gapless line degeneracy is protected by glide reflection symmetry. Based on a simple tight-binding model, we investigate how the topological insulating phase is stabilized by breaking nonsymmorphic symmetries but in the presence of time reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry. In addition, we also discuss the regime where Dirac semimetal is stabilized, having non trivial $Z_2$ invariants even without spin orbit coupling (SOC). Our study can be extended to more general cases where all lattice symmetries are broken and we also discuss possible application to topological Kondo insulators in nonsymmorphic crystals where crystal symmetries can be spontaneously broken as a function of Kondo coupling.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01451","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T03:29:58Z","registered":"2022-03-01T03:29:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T03:29:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Existing quasiclassical dynamics methods based on mapping, such as the linearised semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR) and Poisson bracket mapping equation (PBME) approaches, have been shown to fail in predicting the correct relaxation of electronic-state populations following an initial excitation. Here we generalise our recently published modification to the standard quasiclassical approximation for simulating quantum correlation functions. We show that the electronic-state population operator in any system can be exactly rewritten as a sum of a traceless operator and the identity operator. We show that by treating the latter at a quantum level instead of using the mapping approach, the accuracy of traditional quasiclassical dynamics methods can be drastically improved, without changes to their underlying equations of motion. We demonstrate this approach for the seven-state Frenkel-Exciton model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson light harvesting complex, showing that our modification significantly improves the accuracy of traditional mapping approaches when compared to numerically exact quantum results.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11847","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T03:25:23Z","registered":"2022-02-28T03:25:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T03:25:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A procedure based on group theory is devised to identify and discard QFD coefficients made redundant by symmetry, for arbitrary sampling lattices. This procedure introduces the concept of a degeneracy matrix. Tensor representations are established for the square lattice point group (8-fold symmetry) and hexagonal lattice point group (12-fold symmetry). The analysis is largely applicable to the symmetrisation of any quadratic filter, and generalises to higher order polynomial (Volterra) filters. Experiments on square lattice sampled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery verify that symmetrisation of QFDs can improve their generalisation and discrimination ability.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0601102","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T20:41:55Z","registered":"2022-03-17T20:41:56Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T20:41:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

DyMn2O5 is a representative member of this family. The ferroelectric polarization in DyMn2O5 is claimed to have two anti-parallel components: one (PDM) from the symmetric exchange striction between the Dy3+-Mn4+ interactions and the other (PMM) from the symmetric exchange striction between the Mn3+-Mn4+ interactions. We investigate the evolutions of the two components upon a partial substitution of Mn3+ by nonmagnetic Al3+ in order to tailor the Mn-Mn interactions and then to modulate component PMM in DyMn2-x/2Alx/2O5. It is revealed that the ferroelectric polarization can be successfully reversed by the Al-substitution via substantially suppressing the Mn3+-Mn4+ interactions and thus the PMM. The Dy3+-Mn4+ interactions and the polarization component PDM can sustain against the substitution until a level as high as x=0.2. In addition, the independent Dy spin ordering is shifted remarkably down to an extremely low temperature due to the Al3+ substitution. The present work not only confirms the existence of the two anti-parallel polarization components but also unveils the possibility of tailoring them independently.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 11 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5136","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T05:51:06Z","registered":"2022-03-10T05:51:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T05:51:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

An efficient numerical simulation of large open systems in two spatial dimensions is a challenge. In this work, we develop a tensor network method, based on an infinite Projected Entangled Pair Operator (iPEPO) ansatz, applicable directly in the thermodynamic limit. We incorporate techniques of finding optimal truncations of enlarged network bonds by optimising an objective function appropriate for open systems. Comparisons with numerically exact calculations, both for the dynamics and the steady-state, demonstrate the power of the method. In particular, we consider dissipative transverse quantum Ising and driven-dissipative hard core boson models in non-mean field limits, proving able to capture substantial entanglement in the presence of dissipation. Our method enables to study regimes which are accessible to current experiments but lie well beyond the applicability of existing techniques.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12233","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T05:17:53Z","registered":"2022-02-24T05:17:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T05:17:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Although the phase-integrated spectra are fit best with a single non-thermal component modeled with a power-law (PL) of photon index $\u0393=2.9$, the X-ray pulse profiles do show the presence of phase-separated thermal and non-thermal components. The spectrum extracted from half the rotational phase away from the X-ray peak fits well with either a single blackbody (BB) or a neutron star atmosphere (NA) model, whereas, the spectrum from the rest of the phase range is dominated by a PL. From Bayesian analysis, the estimated BB area is smaller than the expected polar cap area for a dipolar magnetic field with a probability of 86% whereas the area estimate from the NA model is larger with a probability of 80%. Due to the ambiguity in the thermal emission model, the polar cap area cannot be reliably estimated and hence cannot be used to understand the nature of the surface magnetic field. Instead, we can infer the presence of multipolar magnetic field from the misalignment between the pulsar's thermal X-ray peak and the radio emission peak. For J0108$-$1431, we estimated a phase-offset $\u0394\u03d5&gt; 0.1$ between the thermal polar cap emission peak and the radio emission peak and argue that this is best explained by the presence of a multipolar surface magnetic field.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06221","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T04:49:40Z","registered":"2022-02-27T04:49:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T04:49:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our observations were carried out at OASI and SOAR between 2021 October and 2022 January, and reveal a low level of activity relative to which was measured for other long-period comets. In addition, we observed a decrease in brightness as the comet got closer to the Sun. Our photometric data, obtained as C/2021 O3 approached perihelion on 2022 April 21, show that the comet was much less active than what is usually expected in the cases of long-period comets, with $Af\u03c1$ values more in line with those of short-period comets (specifically, the Jupiter Family Comets). On the other hand, the observed increase in the value of the spectral slope as the amount of dust in the coma decreased could indicate that the smaller dust particles were being dispersed from the coma by radiation pressure faster than they were injected by possible sublimation jets. The analysis of its orbital evolution suggests that C/2021 O3 could be a dynamically old comet, or perhaps a new one masquerading as a dynamically old comet, with a likely origin in the Solar system.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10029","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-07-20T01:21:27Z","registered":"2023-07-20T01:21:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-07-20T01:21:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Additionally, label noise is inevitable in large-scale annotations and hinders the applications of learning-based models. Although many deep learning based methods have been proposed for handling long-tailed multi-label recognition or label noise respectively, learning with noisy labels in long-tailed multi-label visual data has not been well-studied because of the complexity of long-tailed distribution entangled with multi-label correlation. To tackle such a critical yet thorny problem, this paper focuses on reducing noise based on some inherent properties of multi-label classification and long-tailed learning under noisy cases. In detail, we propose a Stitch-Up augmentation to synthesize a cleaner sample, which directly reduces multi-label noise by stitching up multiple noisy training samples. Equipped with Stitch-Up, a Heterogeneous Co-Learning framework is further designed to leverage the inconsistency between long-tailed and balanced distributions, yielding cleaner labels for more robust representation learning with noisy long-tailed data. To validate our method, we build two challenging benchmarks, named VOC-MLT-Noise and COCO-MLT-Noise, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared to a variety of baselines, our method achieves superior results.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted by TIP 2023, code is at https://github.com/VamosC/CoLearning-meet-StitchUp","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00880","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-07-04T02:09:48Z","registered":"2023-07-04T02:09:48Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-07-04T02:09:48Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The microstructure of the resulting networks mainly determines their mechanical properties. It remains an important challenge to relate structural transitions to both the molecular properties of the cross-linking molecules and the mechanical response of the network. This can be achieved best by well-defined in vitro model systems in combination with microscopic techniques. Here, we show that with increasing concentrations of the cross-linker HMM (heavy meromyosin) a transition in the mechanical network response occurs. At low cross-linker densities the network elasticity is dominated by the entanglement length of the polymer, while at high HMM densities the cross-linker distance determines the elastic behavior. Using microrheology the formation of heterogeneous networks is observed at low cross-linker concentrations. Micro- and macrorheology both report the same transition to a homogeneous cross-linked phase. This transition is set by a constant average cross-linker distance. Thus, the micro- and macromechanical properties of isotropically cross-linked in vitro actin networks are determined by only one intrinsic network parameter.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0393","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T01:57:46Z","registered":"2022-03-16T01:57:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T01:57:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

As medical resources are limited, deciding on the proper allocation of these resources is a very crucial issue. Besides, uncertainty is a major factor that can affect decisions, especially in medical fields. To cope with this issue, we use fuzzy logic (FL) as one of the most suitable methods in modeling systems with high uncertainty and complexity. We intend to make use of the advantages of FL in decisions on cases that need to treat in ICU. In this study, an interval type-2 fuzzy expert system is proposed for prediction of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. For this prediction task, we also developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Finally, the results of these fuzzy systems are compared to some well-known classification methods such as Naive Bayes (NB), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), Decision Tree (DT), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The results show that the type-2 fuzzy expert system and ANFIS models perform competitively in terms of accuracy and F-measure compared to the other system modeling techniques.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12868","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-22T04:46:08Z","registered":"2022-02-22T04:46:09Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-02-09T01:59:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Close to merger, gravitational radiation-driven inspiral will happen on timescales faster than the effective viscous time at the disk cavity wall, leading to a decoupling of the inner binary dynamics from the surrounding gaseous environment. Here we perform the first simulation of this decoupling process from a magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion disk. In this regime, the central cavity is filled with very strong vertical magnetic flux, regulating accretion onto the binary. Our simulations identify three main stages of this process: (1) Large-scale magnetic flux loss prior to decoupling. (2) Rayleigh-Taylor-driven accretion streams onto the binary during and after decoupling, which can power magnetic tower-like outflows, resembling dual jets.

This created the need for an ASR system that can operate in realistic crowded environments. Thus, speech enhancement is a valuable building block in ASR systems and other applications such as hearing aids, smartphones and teleconferencing systems. In this paper, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based framework is investigated for the task of speech enhancement, more specifically speech denoising of audio tracks. A new architecture based on CasNet generator and an additional feature-based loss are incorporated to get realistically denoised speech phonetics. Finally, the proposed framework is shown to outperform other learning and traditional model-based speech enhancement approaches.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 4 figures and 2 Tables.

Both simulated galaxies and real galaxies with known redshifts were used to estimate the accuracy of redshifts inferred from the multicolor photometry. From the test with simulated galaxies, the uncertainty in the inferred redshifts is about $0.02\\sim0.03$ for a given range of photometric uncertainty of $0.05 \\sim 0.10$. The results with the 27 real galaxies are in good agreement with the simulated ones. The advantage of using BATC intermediate-band system to derive redshift is clear through the comparison with the UBVRI broad-band system. The accuracy in redshift determination with BATC system is mainly affected by the selection of filters and the photometric uncertainties in the observation. When we take the limiting magnitudes of the 15 filters into account, we find that redshift can be determined with good accuracy for galaxies with redshifts less than 0.5, using only filters with central wavelengths shorter than 6000 A.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, accepted for publishing by PASP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0209460","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T03:47:01Z","registered":"2022-03-19T03:47:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T03:47:02Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

While local supersymmetry (SUSY) is necessarily Higgsed at high scales during inflation we show that it can naturally survive down to the $\\sim$ TeV scale in the current era in order to resolve the electroweak hierarchy problem. We show how a suitable inflationary effective potential for the axions can be generated at tree-level by charged fields under the higher-dimensional gauge symmetry. The inflationary trajectory lies along the lightest direction in the bi-axion field space, with periodic effective potential and an effective super-Planckian field range emerging from fundamentally sub-Planckian dynamics. The heavier direction in the field space is shown to also play an important role, as the dominant source of super-Higgsing during inflation. This model presents an interesting interplay of tuning considerations relating the electroweak hierarchy, cosmological constant and inflationary superpotential, where maximal naturalness favors SUSY breaking near the electroweak scale after inflation. The scalar superpartner of the axionic inflaton, the \"sinflaton\", can naturally have $\\sim$ Hubble mass during inflation and sufficiently strong coupling to the inflaton to mediate primordial non-Gaussianities of observable strength in future 21-cm surveys. Non-minimal charged fields under the higher-dimensional gauge symmetry can contribute to periodic modulations in the CMB, within the sensitivity of ongoing measurements.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages, 2 figures; matches published version; minor typos fixed","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05559","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T16:20:21Z","registered":"2022-03-01T16:20:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T16:20:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

As such they are expected to trace the cosmic radio dipole, an anisotropy analogous to the dipole seen in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Results have shown that although the cosmic radio dipole matches the direction of the CMB dipole, it has a significantly larger amplitude. This result challenges our assumption of the Universe being isotropic, which can have large repercussions for the current cosmological paradigm. Though significant measurements have been made, sensitivity to the radio dipole is generally hampered by systematic effects that can cause large biases in the measurement. Here we assess these systematics with data from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). We present the analysis of ten MALS pointings, focusing on systematic effects that could lead to an inhomogeneous catalogue. We describe the calibration and creation of full band continuum images and catalogues, producing a combined catalogue containing 16,313 sources and covering 37.5 square degrees of sky down to a sensitivity of 10 $\u03bc$Jy/beam. We measure the completeness, purity, and flux recovery statistics for these catalogues using simulated data. We investigate different source populations in the catalogues by looking at flux densities and spectral indices, and how they might influence source counts. Using the noise characteristics of the pointings, we find global measures that can be used to correct for the incompleteness of the catalogue, producing corrected number counts down to 100 - 200 $\u03bc$Jy. We show that we can homogenise the catalogues and properly account for systematic effects. We determine that we can measure the dipole to $3\u03c3$ significance with 100 MALS pointings.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 25 figures.

Let $p:\\hat M\\to M$ be a regular covering with structure group $G$, such that $p^*([\u03c9])=0$. Let $\u03be:G\\to\\mathbf{R}$ be the corresponding period homomorphism. Denote by ${\\hat \u039b}_\u03be$ the Novikov completion of the group ring $\\mathbf{Z} G$. Choose a transverse $\u03c9$-gradient $v$. Counting the flow lines of $v$ one defines the Novikov complex $\\mathcal{N}_*$ freely generated over ${\\hat \u039b}_\u03be$ by the set of zeroes of $\u03c9$. In this paper we introduce a refinement of this construction. We define a subring $\\hat\u039b_\u0393$ of ${\\hat \u039b}_\u03be$ and show that the Novikov complex $\\mathcal{N}_*$ is defined actually over $\\hat\u039b_\u0393$ and computes the homology of the chain complex $C_*(\\hat M)\\underset\u039b{\\otimes}\\hat\u039b_\u0393$. When $G\\approx\\mathbf{Z}^2$, and the irrationality degree of $\u03be$ equals 2, the ring $\\hat\u039b_\u0393$ is isomorphic to the ring of series in $2$ variables $x, y$ of the form $\\sum_{r\\in\\mathbf{N}} a_r x^{n_r}y^{m_r}$ where $a_r, n_r, m_r\\in\\mathbf{Z}$ and both $n_r, \\ m_r$ converge to $\\infty$ when $r\\to \\infty$. The algebraic part of the proof is based on a suitable generalization of the classical algorithm of approximating irrational numbers by rationals. The geometric part is a straightforward generalization of the author's proof of the particular case of this theorem concerning the circle-valued Morse maps. In Appendix 1 we give an overview of E. Pitcher's work on circle-valued Morse theory (1939). We show that Pitcher's lower bounds for the number of critical points of a circle-valued Morse map coincide with the torsion-free part of the Novikov inequalities. In Appendix 2 we construct a circle-valued Morse map and its gradient such that its unique Novikov incidence coefficient is a power series in one variable with an arbitrarily small convergence radius.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Eur.

We investigate a family of time-dependent O(3) symmetrical solutions of the Yang--Mills equations, which govern the isotropic high-energy gauge boson production. At low energies our approach reproduces the instanton-induced cross sections. For higher energies we get new results. In particular, we show that the cross section for isotropic multiparticle production remains exponentially small in the running gauge coupling constant. The result applies both to the baryon number violation in the electro-weak theory and to the QCD jet production. We find that the isotropic multi-gluon production cross section falls off approximately as a ninth power of energy but possibly might be observable","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"RUB preprint 52/93, 39p.

We carried out CO J=1-0 and J=3-2 observations of the region of [DBS2003]179 with NANTEN2, ASTE and the Mopra 22m telescope. We identified and mapped two molecular clouds which are likely associated with the cluster. The association is evidenced by the spatial correlation with the 8 micron Spitzer image, and a high ratio of the two transitions of 12CO (J=3-2 to J=1-0). The two clouds show complementary distribution in space and bridge features connecting them in velocity. We frame a hypothesis that the two clouds collided with each other 1-2 Myr ago, and the collision compressed the interface layer, triggering the formation of the cluster. This offers an additional piece of evidence for a super star cluster formed by cloud--cloud collision alongside of the four super star clusters including Wd2, NGC3603, RCW38 and R136. The findings indicate that the known super star clusters having closely associated dust emission are formed by cloud-cloud collision, lending support for the important role of cloud--cloud collision in high-mass star formation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"32 pages, 16 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00441","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T20:27:34Z","registered":"2022-02-26T20:27:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T20:27:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The most powerful method for identifying potentially nearby stars is proper motion (PM) surveys. All old optical surveys avoid, or are at least substantially incomplete, near the Galactic plane. The depth and breadth of the \"Vista Variables in Via Lactea\" (VVV) near-IR survey significantly improves this situation. Taking advantage of the VVV survey database, we have measured PMs in the densest regions of the MW bulge and southern plane in order to complete the census of nearby objects. We have developed a custom PM pipeline based on VVV catalogues from the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit (CASU), by comparing the first epoch of JHKs with the multi-epoch Ks-bands acquired later. Taking advantage of the large time baseline between the 2MASS and the VVV observations, we also obtained 2MASS-VVV PMs. We present a near-IR proper motion catalogue for the whole area of the VVV survey, which includes 3003 moving stellar sources. All of these have been visually inspected and are real PM objects. Our catalogue is in very good agreement with the proper motion data supplied in IR catalogues outside the densest zone of the MW. The majority of the PM objects in our catalogue are nearby M-dwarfs, as expected. This new database allow us to identify 57 common proper motion binary candidates, among which are two new systems within ~30pc of the Sun.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 7 figures, accepted in the MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03520","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T19:38:50Z","registered":"2022-03-05T19:38:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T19:38:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is still unclear how magnetic fields influence the formation and dynamics of massive disks and outflows. Most current information on magnetic fields close to high-mass protostars comes from polarized maser emissions, which allows us to investigate the magnetic field on small scales by using very long-baseline interferometry. The massive star-forming region W75N contains three radio continuum sources (VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3), at three different evolutionary stages, and associated masers, while a large-scale molecular bipolar outflow is also present. Very recently, polarization observations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers at milliarsecond resolution have been able to probe the strength and structure of the magnetic field over more than 2000 AU around VLA1. The magnetic field is parallel to the outflow, suggesting that VLA1 is its powering source. The observations of water masers at 22 GHz can give more information about the gas dynamics and the magnetic fields around VLA1 and VLA2. The NRAO Very Long Baseline Array was used to measure the linear polarization and the Zeeman-splitting of the 22 GHz water masers in the star-forming region W75N. We detected 124 water masers, 36 around VLA1 and 88 around VLA2 of W75N, which indicate two different physical environments around the two sources, where VLA1 is in a more evolved state.

The clock of the green alga Ostreococcus tauri is the simplest plant clock discovered so far. Its many advantages as an experimental system facilitate the testing of computational predictions. We present a model of the Ostreococcus clock in the stochastic process algebra Bio-PEPA and exploit its mapping to different analysis techniques, such as ordinary differential equations, stochastic simulation algorithms and model-checking. The small number of molecules reported for this system tests the limits of the continuous approximation underlying differential equations. We investigate the difference between continuous-deterministic and discrete-stochastic approaches. Stochastic simulation and model-checking allow us to formulate new hypotheses on the system behaviour, such as the presence of self-sustained oscillations in single cells under constant light conditions. We investigate how to model the timing of dawn and dusk in the context of model-checking, which we use to compute how the probability distributions of key biochemical species change over time. These show that the relative variation in expression level is smallest at the time of peak expression, making peak time an optimal experimental phase marker. Building on these analyses, we use approaches from evolutionary systems biology to investigate how changes in the rate of mRNA degradation impacts the phase of a key protein likely to affect fitness. We explore how robust this circadian clock is towards such potential mutational changes in its underlying biochemistry. Our work shows that multiple approaches lead to a more complete understanding of the clock.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4661","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T13:58:26Z","registered":"2022-03-15T13:58:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T13:58:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

As a possible explanation we propose that the CP is due to Faraday conversion (FC) of linear polarisation (LP) synchrotron light which propagates along a line-of-sight (LOS) through twisted magnetic fields. The rotational nature of accretion flows onto black holes naturally generates the required magnetic twist in the emission region, independent of whether it is a jet or an ADAF. The expected twist in both types of flows is of the order of what is required for optimal CP generation. This scenario requires that Faraday rotation (FR) is insignificant in the emission region. Although this is an assumption, it relaxes constraints on the plasma parameters, that were given in scenarios which rely on FR, since there the strength of FR can not be too far from the optimum. The proposed mechanism works in electron-positron (e+-) as well as electron-proton (e/p) plasma. In the latter case, the emission region should consist of individual flux tubes with independent polarities in order to suppress too strong FR. The predominant CP is expected to mostly counter-rotate (rotation is measured here in sky-projection) with respect to the central engine in all cases (jet or ADAF, e+- or e/p plasma). If the proposed mechanism is indeed operating, it will allow to measure the sense of rotation of quasar engines. The engine of SgrA* is then expected to rotate clockwise and therefore counter-Galactic, as do the young hot stars in its vicinity, which are thought to feed SgrA* by their winds. Similarly, we expect the microquasars SS 443 and GRS 1915+105 to rotate clockwise. Generally, sources with Stokes-V&lt;0 (V&gt;0) are expected to rotate clockwise (counter-clockwise) in this scenario.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 3 figures, version accepted by A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212387","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T03:49:38Z","registered":"2022-03-19T03:49:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T03:49:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Such solutions may be of interest in addressing the issue of higher derivative hair or during the later stages of black hole evaporation. Non-Schwarzschild solutions have been studied but we have put earlier results on a firmer footing by finding a systematic asymptotic expansion for the black holes and matching them with known numerical solutions obtained by integrating out from the near horizon region. These asymptotic expansions can be cast in the form of trans-series expansions which we conjecture will be a generic feature of non-Schwarzschild higher derivative black holes. Excitingly we find a new branch of solutions with lower free energy than the Schwarzschild solution, but as found in earlier work, solutions only seem to exist for black holes with large curvatures meaning that one should not generically neglect even higher derivative corrections. This suggests that one effectively recovers the non-hair theorems in this context.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages, 14 figures, v2: references added, v3: some typos corrected, clarifications added, v4: minor typos finally corrected","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02803","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T03:38:25Z","registered":"2022-03-05T03:38:26Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T03:38:26Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Fisher and Muller hypothesized that reproducing by sex can speed up the evolution. They explained that in the sexual reproduction, recombination can combine beneficial alleles that lie on different chromosomes, which speeds up the time that those beneficial alleles spread to the entire population. We consider a population model of fixed size $N$, in which we will focus on two loci on a chromosome. Each allele at each locus can mutate into a beneficial allele at rate $\u03bc_N$. The individuals with 0, 1, and 2 beneficial alleles die at rates $1, 1-s_N$ and $1-2s_N$ respectively. When an individual dies, with probability $1-r_N$, the new individual inherits both alleles from one parent, chosen at random from the population, while with probability $r_N$, recombination occurs, and the new individual receives its two alleles from different parents. Under certain assumptions on the parameters $N, \u03bc_N, s_N$ and $r_N$, we obtain an asymptotic approximation for the time that both beneficial alleles spread to the entire population. When the recombination probability is small, we show that recombination does not speed up the time that the two beneficial alleles spread to the entire population, while when the recombination probability is large, we show that recombination decreases the time, which agrees with Fisher-Muller hypothesis, and confirms the advantage of reproducing by sex.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"65 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09922","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T00:54:33Z","registered":"2022-02-28T00:54:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T00:54:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Using a Boltzmann approach, we study the angular anisotropies of the GW energy density, which is an important tool to disentangle the different cosmological and astrophysical contributions to the SGWB. Anisotropies in the cosmological background are imprinted both at its production, and by GW propagation through the large-scale scalar and tensor perturbations of the universe. The first contribution is not present in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation (as the universe is not transparent to photons before recombination), causing an order one dependence of the anisotropies on frequency. Moreover, we provide a new method to characterize the cosmological SGWB through its possible deviation from a Gaussian statistics. In particular, the SGWB will become a new probe of the primordial non-Gaussianity of the large-scale cosmological perturbations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 1 figure","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00527","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T02:11:32Z","registered":"2022-02-27T02:11:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T02:11:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Recent studies show that deep adversarial domain adaptation models can make markable improvements in performance, which include symmetric and asymmetric architectures.

In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial domain adaptation method named Adversarial Residual Transform Networks (ARTNs) to improve the generalization ability, which directly transforms the source features into the space of target features. In this model, residual connections are used to share features and adversarial loss is reconstructed, thus making the model more generalized and easier to train. Moreover, a special regularization term is added to the loss function to alleviate a vanishing gradient problem, which enables its training process stable. A series of experiments based on Amazon review dataset, digits datasets and Office-31 image datasets are conducted to show that the proposed ARTN can be comparable with the methods of the state-of-the-art.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09578","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T03:53:44Z","registered":"2022-03-03T03:53:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T03:53:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our result can be readily factorized in the closed string channel to yield the boundary state describing the recoiling D-particle. This turned out to agree with the BRST invariant vertex recently proposed by Ishibashi to the leading order in the derivative expansion, but it will receive corrections in subsequent orders. The advantage of our formalism is that it is extendable to deal with more general processes involving multiple D-particles.

The proposed unsupervised-learning architecture is applied to the Gravity Spy dataset, which consists of Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) transient noises with their associated metadata to discuss the potential for online or offline data analysis.

Our Ansatz is an optimized linear superposition of Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki valence bond states, rendering the combination a valence bond liquid dubbed Orbital Resonant Valence Bond. We show that the undoped (one electron/orbital) quantum state of two sites coupled into a global spin singlet is exactly written employing only spin-1/2 singlets linking orbitals at nearest-neighbor sites. Generalizing to longer chains defines our variational state visualized geometrically expressing our chain as a two-leg ladder, with one orbital per leg. As in Anderson's resonating valence-bond state, our undoped variational state contains preformed singlet pairs that via doping become mobile leading to superconductivity. Doped real materials with one-dimensional substructures, two near-degenerate orbitals, and intermediate Hubbard U/W strengths -- W the carrier's bandwidth -- could realize spin-singlet pairing if on-site anisotropies are small. If these anisotropies are robust, spin-triplet pairing emerges.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00589","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T01:33:10Z","registered":"2022-02-27T01:33:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T01:33:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We use entire four-year light curves to accurately measure the frequencies of the strongest pulsation modes, then track the pulsation phases at those frequencies in 10-d segments. This produces a series of time-delay measurements in which binarity is apparent as a periodic modulation whose amplitude gives the projected light travel time across the orbit. Fourier analysis of this time-delay curve provides the parameters of the orbit, including the period, eccentricity, angle of ascending node and time of periastron passage. Differentiating the time-delay curve yields the full radial-velocity curve directly from the Kepler photometry, without the need for spectroscopy. We show examples with $\u03b4$ Scuti stars having large numbers of pulsation modes, including one system in which both components of the binary are pulsating. The method is straightforward to automate, thus radial velocity curves can be derived for hundreds of non-eclipsing binary stars from Kepler photometry alone.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, plus 3-page appendix. 8 figures, all of which are colour.

Understanding how these tools are used is key to improving them to better support learners in their writing and learning processes. In this paper, we present a novel pipeline with insights into the revision behavior of students at scale. We leverage a data set of two groups using an adaptive writing support tool in an educational setting. With our novel pipeline, we show that the tool was effective in promoting revision among the learners. Depending on the writing feedback, we were able to analyze different strategies of learners when revising their texts, we found that users of the exemplary case improved over time and that females tend to be more efficient. Our research contributes a pipeline for measuring SRL behaviors at scale in writing tasks (i.e., engagement or revision behavior) and informs the design of future adaptive writing support systems for education, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness in supporting student writing.

Aims: We measure the MMR in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We compare our measured MMR to that measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and study the dependence of the MMR on various selection criteria to identify potential causes for disparities seen in the literature. Methods: We use strong emission line ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. We then apply a range of selection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines, as well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in the inferred MMR. Results: The shape and position of the MMR can differ significantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used. After selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we find that the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061&lt; z&lt;0.35 in GAMA is in reasonable agreement with that found in the SDSS despite the difference in the luminosity range probed. Conclusions: In view of the significant variations of the MMR brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteria and method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the MMR from different surveys and studies directly.

To evaluate this, we study structures adopted by purely classical quadrupoles using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations of fcc and hcp quadrupolar lattices. Both undergo first-order phase transitions from rotationally ordered to disordered structures, as indicated by a discontinuity in both quadrupole interaction energy ($\\mathcal{E}_{qq}$) and its heat capacity. Cooling fcc reliably induced a transition to the P$a3$ structure, whereas cooling hcp gave inconsistent, frustrated and $c/a$-ratio-dependent broken symmetry states. Analysing the lowest-energy hcp states using simulated annealing, we found P$6_3/m$ and P$ca2_1$ structures found previously as minimum-energy structures in full electronic structure calculations. The candidate structures for hydrogen Phases III-V were not observed. This demonstrates that $\\mathcal{E}_{qq}$ is the dominant interaction determining the symmetry breaking in Phase II. The disorder transition occurs at significantly lower temperature in hcp than fcc, showing that the $\\mathcal{E}_{qq}$ cannot be responsible for hydrogen Phase II being based on hcp.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06516","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T00:05:56Z","registered":"2022-02-27T00:05:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T00:05:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Using ULTRACAM data, we show that mid-egress times determined for simultaneous data taken at different wavelengths agree with each other. The large variations in the observed eclipse times cannot be explained by planetary models containing up to three planets, because of poor fits to the data as well as orbital instability on short time scales. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the O-C diagram of almost 140 seconds is also too great to be caused by Applegate's mechanism, movement of the accretion spot on the surface of the white dwarf, or by asynchronous rotation of the white dwarf.

Our results confirm previous findings that isolated galaxies are found across the complete revised Hubble sequence, with intermediate to late-type (Sb-Sc) spirals being relatively more common. Elmegreen Arm Classifications are also presented, and show that more than 50% of the 514 spirals in the sample for which an arm class could be judged are grand design (AC 8,9,12). The visual bar fraction for the sample is ~50%, but only 16% are classified as strongly-barred (SB). The dominant family classification is SA (nonbarred), the dominant inner variety classification is (s) (pure spiral), and the dominant outer variety classification is no outer ring, pseudoring, or lens. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to check for potential biases in the morphological interpretations, and for any possible relation between rings, bars, and arm classes with local environment and far-infrared excess.

We numerically simulate these observed phenomena using totally anisotropic, power-law models for the electron density fluctuations which cause the scattering. By comparing our results to the scattered image of PSR B0834+06 and, independently, to dual-frequency light curves of the quasar PKS1257-326, we constrain the nature of the scattering media on these lines of sight. We find that models with spectral indices slightly below \u03b2=3, including the one-dimensional Kolmogorov model, are broadly consistent with both data sets. We confirm that a single physical model suffices for both sources, with the scattering medium simply being more distant in the case of B0834+06. This reinforces the idea that intra-day variability and parabolic arcs have a common cause in a type of interstellar structure which, though obscure, is commonplace. However, the implied gas pressure fluctuations are large compared to typical interstellar pressures, and the magnetic stresses are much larger still. Thus while these scattering media may be commonplace, their underlying dynamics appear quite extraordinary.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted to MNRAS, 8 pages, 4 figures, figure quality reduced slightly","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0633","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T01:02:41Z","registered":"2022-03-11T01:02:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T01:02:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Historical milestones have been frequently associated with computers matching or outperforming humans in difficult cognitive tasks (e.g. face recognition [2], personality classification [3], driving cars [4], or playing video games [5]), or defeating humans in strategic zero-sum encounters (e.g. Chess [6], Checkers [7], Jeopardy! [8], Poker [9], or Go [10]). In contrast, less attention has been given to developing autonomous machines that establish mutually cooperative relationships with people who may not share the machine's preferences. A main challenge has been that human cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but rather relies on intuition [11], cultural norms [12], emotions and signals [13, 14, 15, 16], and pre-evolved dispositions toward cooperation [17], common-sense mechanisms that are difficult to encode in machines for arbitrary contexts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm with novel mechanisms for generating and acting on signals to produce a new learning algorithm that cooperates with people and other machines at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. This is the first general-purpose algorithm that is capable, given a description of a previously unseen game environment, of learning to cooperate with people within short timescales in scenarios previously unanticipated by algorithm designers. This is achieved without complex opponent modeling or higher-order theories of mind, thus showing that flexible, fast, and general human-machine cooperation is computationally achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of algorithmic mechanisms.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"An updated version of this paper was published in Nature Communications","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06207","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T03:10:50Z","registered":"2022-03-05T03:10:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T03:10:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Traditional star-galaxy classification techniques often rely on feature estimation from catalogues, a process susceptible to introducing inaccuracies, thereby potentially jeopardizing the classification's reliability. Certain galaxies, especially those not manifesting as extended sources, can be misclassified when their shape parameters and flux solely drive the inference. We aim to create a robust and accurate classification network for identifying stars and galaxies directly from astronomical images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and additional information about the source position, we aim to accurately classify all stars and galaxies within a survey, particularly those with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) near the detection limit. Methods. The AutoSourceID-Classifier (ASID-C) algorithm developed here uses 32x32 pixel single filter band source cutouts generated by the previously developed ASID-L code. ASID-C utilizes CNNs to distinguish these cutouts into stars or galaxies, leveraging their strong feature-learning capabilities. Subsequently, we employ a modified Platt Scaling calibration for the output of the CNN. This technique ensures that the derived probabilities are effectively calibrated, delivering precise and reliable results. Results. We show that ASID-C, trained on MeerLICHT telescope images and using the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) morphological classification, outperforms similar codes like SourceExtractor. ASID-C opens up new possibilities for accurate celestial object classification, especially for sources with a S/N near the detection limit. Potential applications of ASID-C, like real-time star-galaxy classification and transient's host identification, promise significant contributions to astronomical research.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14456","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-07-28T02:21:28Z","registered":"2023-07-28T02:21:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-12-21T03:52:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We present scintillation bandwidth measurements for all MSPs in the sample, some for the first time, and scintillation timescale measurements and lower limits for all MSPs for the first time. In addition, we present upper limits on the contribution of pulse phase jitter to the timing residual error for all MSPs. These long observations also allow us to constrain variations in dispersion measures (DMs) on hour-long timescales for several millisecond pulsars. We find that there are no apparent DM variations in any of the MSPs studied on these timescales as expected. In light of new radio telescopes such as the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), which will be able to time many pulsars for a short time each day, we search for differences in timing precisions from continuous TOAs and from equivalent length time-discontinuous TOAs. We find no differences in the precision for any MSP in our sample, as expected.

We prove that under a good combination of these two scales, the population process is approximated in the long time scale of mutations by a Markov pure jump process describing the successive trait equilibria of the population. This process, which generalizes the so-called trait substitution sequence, is called polymorphic evolution sequence. Then we introduce a scaling of the size of mutations and we study the polymorphic evolution sequence in the limit of small mutations. From this study in the neighborhood of evolutionary singularities, we obtain a full mathematical justification of a heuristic criterion for the phenomenon of evolutionary branching.

Particularly, PC-PK1 improves the description for isospin dependence of binding energy along either the isotopic or the isotonic chains, which makes it more reliable for application in exotic nuclei. The predictive power of PC-PK1 is also illustrated for the nuclear low-lying excitation states in a five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian in which the parameters are determined by constrained calculations for triaxial shapes.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"32 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables, accepted by Phys.

However, most of Earth's identified co-orbitals are moving along horseshoe-type orbits. The current tally of minor bodies considered to be Earth co-orbitals amounts to 18; of them, 12 are horseshoes, five are quasi-satellites, and one is a Trojan. The semimajor axis values of all these bodies librate between $0.983$ au and $1.017$ au. In this work, we have studied the dynamical behaviour of objects following orbits with semimajor axis within this range that may be in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth. Our results show that asteroids 2016 CO$_{246}$, 2017 SL$_{16}$, and 2017 XQ$_{60}$ are moving along asymmetrical horseshoe-type orbits; the asteroid 2018 PN$_{22}$ follows a nearly symmetric or regular horseshoe-type orbit. Asteroids 2016 CO$_{246}$, 2017 SL$_{16}$, and 2017 XQ$_{60}$ can remain in the horseshoe co-orbital state for about $900$ yr, $3300$ yr and $2700$ yr, respectively. Asteroid 2018 PN$_{22}$ has a more chaotic dynamical behaviour; it may not stay in a horseshoe co-orbital state for more than 200 yr. The horseshoe libration periods of 2016 CO$_{246}$, 2017 SL$_{16}$, 2017 XQ$_{60}$, and 2018 PN$_{22}$ are 280, 255, 411, and 125 yr, respectively.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables.

Constraints on tori formation and emergence of RADs instabilities, accretion onto the central attractor and tori collision emergence, are investigated. The results of this analysis show that the role of the central BH spin-mass ratio, the magnetic field and the relative fluid rotation and tori rotation with respect the central BH, are crucial elements in determining the accretion tori features, providing ultimately evidence of a strict correlation between SMBH spin, fluid rotation and magnetic fields in RADs formation and evolution. More specifically we proved that magnetic field and disks rotation are in fact strongly constrained, as tori formation and evolution in RADs depend on the toroidal magnetic fields parameters. Eventually this analysis identifies specific classes of tori, for restrict ranges of magnetic field parameter, that can be observed around some specific SMBHs identified by their dimensionless spin.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 7 multi-panels figures.

The structural transition between the two crystallographic phases is of the first-order type with large thermal hysteresis in CrCl3 and CrI3. We studied crystal structures and structural phase transitions of vanadium-based counterparts VCl3, VBr3, and VI3 by measuring specific heat, magnetization, and X-ray diffraction as functions of temperature and observed an inverse situation. In these cases, the high-temperature phase has a higher symmetry while the low-temperature structure reveals a lower symmetry.

A correct understanding and modeling requires the knowledge of nuclear properties far from stability and a detailed prescription of the astrophysical environment. Experiments at CERN/ISOLDE have played a pioneering role in exploring the characteristics of nuclear structure in terms of masses and beta-decay properties. Initial examinations paid attention to far unstable nuclei with magic neutron numbers related to r-process peaks, while present activities are centered on the evolution of shell effects with the distance from the valley of stability. We first show in site-independent applications the effect of both types of nuclear properties on r-process abundances. Then, we explore the results of calculations related to two different `realistic' astrophysical sites, (i) the supernova neutrino wind and (ii) neutron star mergers. We close with a list of remaining theoretical and experimental challenges needed to overcome for a full understanding of the nature of the r-process, and the role CERN/ISOLDE can play in this process.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"LATEX, 38 pages, 16 figures, submitted to Hyperfine Interactions","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9907071","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T20:24:50Z","registered":"2022-03-20T20:24:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T20:24:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Raster scans and slit-jaw imaging observations performed in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) channels were used. Large transverse oscillations are revealed by the far wings profiles after accurately removing the bulk average line profiles of each sequence. Different regions around the Sun are considered. Accordingly, the cool material of spicules is observed in Mg II lines rather dispersed up to coronal heights. In the quiet Sun and especially in a polar coronal hole, we study dynamical properties of the dispersed spicules-material off-limb using a high spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions IRIS observations. We suggest that numerous small-scale jet-like spicules show rapid twisting and swaying motions evidenced by the large distortion and dispersion of the line profiles, including impressive periodic Doppler shifts. Most of these events repeatedly appear in red- and blue-shifts above the limb throughout the whole interval of the observation datasets with an average swaying speed of order +/-35 kms-1 reaching a maximum value of 50 km s-1 in the polar coronal hole region, well above the 2.2 Mm heights. We identified for the 1st time waves with a short period of order of 100 sec and less and transverse amplitudes of order of +/- 20 to 30 km s-1 with the definite signature of Alfven waves.

This work is a follow-up to Wang et al., using significantly upgraded new simulations. We focus on the contribution of the velocity vortices and the fast shock reflection and refraction in the solar corona to the formation of the EUV waves. Following the loss of equilibrium in the coronal magnetic structure, the flux rope exhibits rapid motions and invokes the fast-mode shock forward of the rope, which then produces the type II radio burst. The expansion of the fast shock, which is associated with outward motion, takes place in various directions, and the downward expansion shows the reflection and the refraction as a result of the non-uniform background plasma. The reflected component of the fast shock propagates upward and the refracted component propagates downward. As the refracted component reaches the boundary surface, a weak echo is excited. The Moreton wave is invoked as the fast shock touches the bottom boundary, so the Moreton wave lags the type II burst. A secondary echo occurs in the area where reflection of the fast shock encounters the slow-mode shock, and the nearby magnetic field lines are further distorted because of the interaction between the secondary echo and the velocity vortices. Our results indicate that the EUV wave may arise from various processes that are revealed in the new simulations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 16 figures, to appear in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00328","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T14:38:08Z","registered":"2022-03-07T14:38:09Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T14:38:09Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To MCMC, proper priors and sufficient iterations are prerequisites ensuring the accuracy of red noise estimation. We used MCMC-based Bayesian inferences to estimate 100 groups of red noise synthesized randomly for evaluating its accuracy. At the same time, the Brooks-Gelman algorithm was employed to precisely diagnose the convergence of the Markov chains generated by MCMC. The root-mean-square error of parameter inferences to the synthetic data is only 1.14. Furthermore, we applied the algorithm to analyze the oscillation modes in a sunspot and a flare. A 70 s period is detected in the sunspot umbra in addition to 3- and 5-minute periods, and a 40 s period is detected in the flare. The results prove that estimating red noise with MCMC-based Bayesian has more high accuracy in the case of proper priors and convergence. We also find that the number of iterations increases dramatically to achieve convergence as the number of parameters grows. Therefore, we strongly recommend that when estimating red noise with MCMC-based Bayesian, different initial values must be selected to ensure that the entire posterior distribution is covered.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09816","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T03:03:58Z","registered":"2022-02-26T03:03:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T03:03:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Utilizing the Bloch-Floquet theorem along with the transfer matrix method we determine the dispersion relation which relates the incremental fields frequency and the phase velocity. Ranges of frequencies at which waves cannot propagate are identified whenever the Bloch-parameter is complex. These band-gaps depend on the phases properties, their volume fraction, and most importantly on the electric bias field. Our analysis reveals how these band-gaps can be shifted and their width can be modified by changing the bias electric field. This implies that by controlling the electrostatic bias field desired frequencies can be filtered out.

For the simplest two-sublattice antiferromagnet on a bipartite lattice, we derive Andreev-type equations and show that their solutions lead to a novel channel of quasiparticle reflection. In particular, quasiparticles in a normal metal with energies less than or comparable to the antiferromagnetic gap experience spin-dependent retroreflection at antiferromagnet-normal metal (AF/N) transparent (100) and (110) interfaces. A relative phase difference of pi between up spin and down spin quasiparticle reflection amplitudes is shown to lead to zero-energy interface bound states on AF/sSC interfaces. For an sSC/AF/sSC junction, these bound states are found to be split, due to a finite width of the AF interlayer, and carry the supercurrent. At AF/dSC interfaces we find no zero-energy bound states for both interface orientations we considered, in contrast with the case of (110) impenetrable surface of a dSC.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408032","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T23:54:59Z","registered":"2022-03-17T23:55:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T23:55:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

First, if the control is not unique which is most input energy efficient. Second, if exact tracking is infeasible which control performs most accurately. These are typical challenges for over-actuated systems and for under-actuated systems, respectively. We formulate both goals as optimal output regulation problems. Then we contribute two new sets of regulator equations to output regulation theory that provide the desired solutions. A thorough study indicates solvability and uniqueness under weak assumptions. E.g., we can always determine the solution of the classical regulator equations that is most input energy efficient. This is of great value if there are infinitely many solutions. We derive our results by a linear quadratic tracking approach and establish a useful link to output regulation theory.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 0 figures, final version to appear in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12231","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T18:38:34Z","registered":"2022-03-01T18:38:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T18:38:35Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The symmetric projection binds potentially diverging copies of solutions, thereby remedying the main drawback of the extended phase space approach. Moreover, our semiexplicit method is symplectic in the original phase space. This is in contrast to existing extended phase space integrators, which are symplectic only in the extended phase space. We demonstrate that our method exhibits an excellent long-time preservation of invariants, and also that it tends to be as fast as and can be faster than Tao's explicit modified extended phase space integrator particularly for small enough time steps and with higher-order implementations and for higher-dimensional problems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"29 pages, 12 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10915","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-20T02:16:29Z","registered":"2022-02-20T02:16:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-03-24T05:08:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We consider mono-, bi-, and trilayers of the H polytype of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, and WSe2 and provide a full database of electronic structures and Hall coefficients for hole and electron doping. We find that, for both electron and hole doping, the electronic structure depends on the number of layers and cannot be described by a rigid band shift. Furthermore, it is important to relax the structure under the asymmetric electric field. Interestingly, while the width of the conducting channel depends on the doping, the number of occupied bands at each given k point is almost uncorrelated with the thickness of the doping-charge distribution. Finally, we calculate within the constant-relaxation-time approximation the electrical conductivity and the inverse Hall coefficient. We demonstrate that in some cases the charge determined by Hall-effect measurements can deviate from the real charge by up to 50%. For hole-doped MoTe2 the Hall charge has even the wrong polarity at low temperature. We provide the mapping between the doping charge and the Hall coefficient.

Crucially, the typical states usually represent only a small fraction of the total number of possible states, and yet the characterization of the set of typical states -- the typical set -- alone is sufficient to describe the macroscopic behavior of a given system. Consequently, the concept of typicality, and the associated Asymptotic Equipartition Property allow for a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom needed for system's statistical description. The mathematical rationale for such a simplification in the description is due to the phenomenon of concentration of measure. The later emerges for equilibrium configurations thanks to very strict constraints on the underlying dynamics, such as weekly interacting and (almost) independent system constituents. The question naturally arises as to whether the concentration of measure and related typicality considerations can be extended and applied to more general complex systems, and if so, what mathematical structure can be expected in the ensuing generalized thermodynamics. In this paper we illustrate the relevance of the concept of typicality in the toy model context of the \"thermalized\" coin and show how this leads naturally to Shannon entropy. We also show an intriguing connection: The characterization of typical sets in terms of Renyi and Tsallis entropies naturally leads to the free energy and partition function, respectively, and makes their relationship explicit. Finally, we propose potential ways to generalize the concept of typicality to systems where the standard microscopic assumptions do not hold.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06537","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-09-11T02:02:13Z","registered":"2024-09-11T02:02:14Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-01-14T04:18:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Most of the material resides in a single narrow velocity component -- offering a rare opportunity to probe the primarily molecular core of a single interstellar cloud with little associated diffuse atomic gas. Detailed analyses of the spectra indicate that: (1) the molecular fraction in the main cloud is high [$f$(H$_2$) $&gt;$ 0.8]; (2) the gas is fairly cold ($T_{\\rm k}$ = 40--43 K, from the rotational excitation of H$_2$ and C$_2$); (3) the local hydrogen density $n_{\\rm H}$ $\\sim$ 1500 cm$^{-3}$ (from the C$_2$ excitation, the fine-structure excitation of C$^0$, and simple chemical models); (4) the unusually high excitation temperatures for $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO may be largely due to radiative excitation; (5) $N$(C$^+$):$N$(CO):$N$(C) $\\sim$ 100:10:1; (6) the depletions of many elements are more severe than those seen in any other sight line, and the detailed pattern of depletions differs from those derived from larger samples of Galactic sight lines; and (7) the various neutral/first ion ratios do not yield consistent estimates for the electron density, even when the effects of grain-assisted recombination and low-temperaure dielectronic recombination are considered.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted to ApJ, 89 pages, 13 tables, 26 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10846","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T11:52:39Z","registered":"2022-02-25T11:52:39Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T11:52:39Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, there is no need for (softly broken) supersymmetry to achieve the stabilization - it can be arranged for a reasonably wide range of couplings and mass scales. The primary instability in the model is the run-away of the radion vacuum expectation value. It turns out that the requirement of the radion stability, in the Higgs case, favours a Higgs boson mass below 0.26 TeV, which is consistent with the Standard Model upper bound that follows from the electroweak precision measurements. The typical radion mass is of the order of 10^{-6} eV. The radion mass can be made larger by rising the scale of fermion masses, as clearly seen in the Higgsless case. The cosmological constant may be cancelled by suitable counterterms, in such a way that the stabilization is not affected.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 2 figures, references added","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0403012","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T15:29:04Z","registered":"2022-03-18T15:29:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T15:29:04Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The Fisher information has been studied extensively when the parameter is inscribed on a quantum state by a unitary process, e.g., Mach-Zehnder or Ramsey interferometry. Here, we investigate the case that a Hamiltonian parameter to be estimated is imprinted on eigenstates of that Hamiltonian, and thus is not necessarily encoded by a unitary operator. Taking advantage of the fact that the Lieb-Liniger model is exactly solvable, the Fisher information is determined for periodic and hard-wall boundary conditions, varying number of particles, and for excited states of type-I and type-II in the Lieb-Liniger terminology. We discuss the dependence of the Fisher information on interaction strength and system size, to further evaluate the metrological aspects of the model. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the Fisher information displays a maximum when we vary the system size, indicating that the distinguishability of the wavefunctions is largest when the Lieb-Liniger parameter is at the crossover between the Bose-Einstein condensate and Tonks-Girardeau limits. The saturability of this Fisher information by the absorption imaging method is assessed by a specific modeling of the latter.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06193","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-09-14T01:17:55Z","registered":"2022-09-14T01:17:56Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-01-02T02:18:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

With the exception of IRAS 07598+6508, high quality X-ray spectra obtained with XMM or Chandra show modest (30-340 eV) equivalent widths of the 6.4 keV Fe K alpha emission line and clear signatures for absorption at a level of 4-33 * 10^22 cm^-2 for the main power-law components from the AGNs. These spectral properties are typical of Compton-thin AGNs, and so we estimate absorption-corrected 2-10 keV X-ray luminosities for the AGNs, Lx(2-10keV), using the Compton-thin assumption. We compare the Lx(2-10 keV) values with broad optical/near-infrared emission-line luminosities, and confirm a previous finding by Imanishi &amp; Ueno that the Lx(2-10 keV) to broad-emission-line luminosity ratios in ULIRGs are systematically lower than those of moderately infrared-luminous type-1 AGNs. A comparison of independent energy diagnostic methods suggests that the AGNs are underluminous in the 2-10 keV band with respect to their overall spectral energy distributions, as opposed to the broad emission lines being overluminous. This X-ray under-luminosity should be taken into account when using 2-10 keV X-ray data to investigate the energetic contribution from AGNs to the large infrared luminosities of ULIRGs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 3 figures, accepted by AJ (2004 February issue)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0311112","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T19:08:43Z","registered":"2022-03-21T19:08:44Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T19:08:44Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Particular care is also devoted to the calculation of the rearrangement term, thus ensuring thermodynamic consistency. We compare the results of the multi-component plasma calculations with those obtained within a one-component (single-nucleus) approach, showing that important differences arise between the predictions of the two treatments. In particular, the abundances of helium clusters become important using a complete multi-component plasma approach, and eventually dominate the whole distribution at higher temperature in the crust.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to the European Physical Journal A (EPJA) for the Topical Collection \"The Nuclear Many-Body Problem\"","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01533","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-09-07T14:38:01Z","registered":"2023-09-07T14:38:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-12-14T02:46:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Spin ice differs from water ice in the important respect that its fundamental constituents, the spins of the magnetic ions, can be removed through replacement with non-magnetic ions while keeping the lattice structure intact. In order to investigate the interplay of frustrated interactions and quenched disorder, we have performed systematic heat capacity measurements on spin ice materials which have been thus diluted up to 90%. Investigations of both Ho and Dy spin ices reveal that the zero point entropy depends non-monotonically on dilution and approaches the value of Rln2 in the limit of high dilution.

Many chronic conditions, like neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, correlate with complex tissue changes that are difficult to explore using two-dimensional histology. While three-dimensional techniques such as confocal and light-sheet microscopy are well-established, they are time consuming, require expensive instrumentation, and are limited to small tissue volumes. Three-dimensional microscopy is therefore impractical in clinical settings and often limited to core facilities at major research institutions. There would be a tremendous benefit to providing clinicians and researchers with the ability to routinely image large three-dimensional tissue volumes at cellular resolution. In this paper, we propose an imaging methodology that enables fast and inexpensive three-dimensional imaging that can be readily integrated into current histology pipelines. This method relies on block-face imaging of paraffin-embedded samples using deep-ultraviolet excitation. The imaged surface is then ablated to reveal the next tissue section for imaging. The final image stack is then aligned and reconstructed to provide tissue models that exceed the depth and resolution achievable with modern three-dimensional imaging systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04358","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T20:37:50Z","registered":"2022-02-27T20:37:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T20:37:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To describe the trends of the stiffness with doping is it sufficient to account for the exchange coupling between nearest neighbors. The polarizability of the impurities is not an important factor for the spin wave stiffness. Rather, the decisive factor is the hybridization between the impurity and the host states as reflected by changes in the Bloch spectral function.

Many scientists' research increasingly depends on the quality and availability of software upon which their works are built. To highlight some of these issues and share experiences, the First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE1) was held in November 2013 in conjunction with the SC13 Conference. The workshop featured keynote presentations and a large number (54) of solicited extended abstracts that were grouped into three themes and presented via panels. A set of collaborative notes of the presentations and discussion was taken during the workshop. Unique perspectives were captured about issues such as comprehensive documentation, development and deployment practices, software licenses and career paths for developers. Attribution systems that account for evidence of software contribution and impact were also discussed. These include mechanisms such as Digital Object Identifiers, publication of \"software papers\", and the use of online systems, for example source code repositories like GitHub. This paper summarizes the issues and shared experiences that were discussed, including cross-cutting issues and use cases. It joins a nascent literature seeking to understand what drives software work in science, and how it is impacted by the reward systems of science. These incentives can determine the extent to which developers are motivated to build software for the long-term, for the use of others, and whether to work collaboratively or separately. It also explores community building, leadership, and dynamics in relation to successful scientific software.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Journal of Open Research Software, 2014","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7414","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T07:52:34Z","registered":"2022-03-10T07:52:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T07:52:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The existing MIM methods adopt the strategy to mask random patches of the image and reconstruct the missing pixels, which only considers semantic information at a lower level, and causes a long pre-training time.This paper presents HybridMIM, a novel hybrid self-supervised learning method based on masked image modeling for 3D medical image segmentation.Specifically, we design a two-level masking hierarchy to specify which and how patches in sub-volumes are masked, effectively providing the constraints of higher level semantic information. Then we learn the semantic information of medical images at three levels, including:1) partial region prediction to reconstruct key contents of the 3D image, which largely reduces the pre-training time burden (pixel-level); 2) patch-masking perception to learn the spatial relationship between the patches in each sub-volume (region-level).and 3) drop-out-based contrastive learning between samples within a mini-batch, which further improves the generalization ability of the framework (sample-level). The proposed framework is versatile to support both CNN and transformer as encoder backbones, and also enables to pre-train decoders for image segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four widely-used public medical image segmentation datasets, including BraTS2020, BTCV, MSD Liver, and MSD Spleen. The experimental results show the clear superiority of HybridMIM against competing supervised methods, masked pre-training approaches, and other self-supervised methods, in terms of quantitative metrics, timing performance and qualitative observations.

The majority (70%) of the emission in the 0.3 - 10.0 keV band is diffuse, and the remaining 30% is resolved into 49 discrete sources. Most of the discrete sources associated with the galaxy appear to be low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The luminosity function of the LMXB sources is well-fit by a broken power-law with a break luminosity comparable to the Eddington luminosity for a 1.4 solar mass neutron star. It is likely that those sources with luminosities above the break are accreting black holes and those below are mostly neutron stars in binary systems. Spectra were extracted for the total emission, diffuse emission, and sum of the resolved sources; the spectral fits for all require a model including both a soft and hard component. The diffuse emission is predominately soft while the emission from the sources is mostly hard. Approximately 24% of the diffuse emission arises from unresolved LMXBs, with the remainder resulting from thermal emission from hot gas. There is a very bright source at the projected position of the nucleus of the galaxy. The spectrum and luminosity derived from this central source are consistent with it being an AGN; the galaxy also is a weak radio source. Finally, the diffuse emission exhibits significant substructure with an intriguing spiral feature passing through the center of the galaxy. The X-ray spectrum and surface brightness of the spiral feature are consistent with adiabatic or shock compression of ambient gas, but not with cooling. This feature may be due to compression of the hot interstellar gas by radio lobes or jets associated with the AGN.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages using emulateapj.sty; ApJ, in press; revised version includes correction to error in the L_X,src/L_B ratio as well as other revisions","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012481","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T18:58:44Z","registered":"2022-03-21T18:58:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T18:58:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The simplest theory is that introduced by Edwards and Wilkinson (EW), which is linear and soluble. Its non linear generalization by Kardar, Parisi and Zhang (KPZ), resulted in many subsequent studies. Yet both theories EW and KPZ contain an unphysical feature. When deposition of material is stopped both theories predict that as time tends to infinity, the surface becomes flat. In fact, of course, the final surface is not flat, but simply has no gradients larger than the gradient related to the angle of repose. We modify the EW and KPZ to accommodate this feature and study the consequences for the simpler system which is a modification of the EW equation. In spite of the fact that the equation describing the evolution of the surface is not linear, we find that the steady state in the presence of noise is not very different in the long wave length limit from that of the linear EW. The situation is quite different from that of EW when deposition stops.

If more fermions existed in the early Universe, then the spin-torsion coupling causes a bounce at a lower energy and larger scale factor. Recent observations of high-energy photons from gamma-ray bursts indicate that spacetime may behave classically even at scales below the Planck length, supporting the classical spin-torsion mechanism of the big bounce.

This motivates further work to evaluate the accuracy with which these SNe can be used as metallicity indicators. To assess this accuracy we present a sample of SNII HII-region spectroscopy, from which environment abundances are derived. These environment abundances are compared to the observed strength of metal lines in SN spectra. Combining our sample with measurements from the literature, we present oxygen abundances of 119 host HII regions, by extracting emission line fluxes and using abundance diagnostics. Then, following Dessart et al., these abundances are compared to equivalent widths of Fe 5018 A at various time and colour epochs. Our distribution of inferred SNII host HII-region abundances has a range of ~0.6 dex. We confirm the dearth of SNeII exploding at metallicities lower than those found (on average) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The equivalent width of Fe 5018 A at 50 days post explosion shows a statistically significant correlation with host HII-region oxygen abundance. The strength of this correlation increases if one excludes abundance measurements derived far from SN explosion sites. The correlation significance also increases if we only analyse a 'gold' IIP sample, and if a colour epoch is used in place of time. In addition, no evidence is found of correlation between progenitor metallicity and SN light-curve or spectral properties - except for that stated above with respect to Fe 5018 A equivalent width - suggesting progenitor metallicity is not a driving factor in producing the diversity observed in our sample. This study provides observational evidence of the usefulness of SNII as metallicity indicators. We finish with a discussion of the methodology needed to use SN spectra as independent metallicity diagnostics throughout the Universe.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophycis","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00011","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T00:19:37Z","registered":"2022-03-07T00:19:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T00:19:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Motivated by this observation, we microscopically derive the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for noncentrosymmetric superconductors with Rashba type spin orbit interaction. Cooper pairing is assumed to occur between electrons only in the same spin split band and pair scattering is allowed to occur between two spin split bands. The GL theory of such a system predicts two transition temperatures, the higher of which is the conventional critical temperature $T_c$ while the lower one $T^*$ corresponds to the cross-over from a mixed singlet-triplet phase at lower temperatures to only spin-singlet or spin-triplet (depending on the sign of the interband scattering potential) phase at higher temperatures. As a consequence, $n_s (T)$ shows a kink at this cross-over temperature. We attribute the temperature at which sudden change of slope occurs in the observed $n_s (T)$ to the temperature $T^*$. This may also be associated with the observed kink in the penetration depth data of CePt$_3$Si. We have also estimated critical field near critical temperature.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 1 figure","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4121","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T05:30:41Z","registered":"2022-03-16T05:30:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T05:30:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Existing continuation methods for parametric stability analysis are based on marching along an airspeed parameter until the flutter point is found - an approach which may waste computational effort on low-airspeed system behavior, before a flutter point is located and characterized. Here, we describe a pseudospectral continuation approach which instead marches outwards from the system's flutter points, from points of instability to points of increasing damping, allowing efficient characterization of the subcritical and supercritical behavior of the system. This approach ties together aeroelastic stability analysis and abstract linear algebra, and provides efficient methods for computing practical aeroelastic stability properties - for instance, flight envelopes based on maximum modal damping, and the location of borderline-stable zones.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Technical note","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09816","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-01-25T03:15:30Z","registered":"2022-01-25T03:15:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-11-16T02:11:09Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Subsequently, high-fidelity finite element analysis on a representative uni-directional laminate model under different stress states is performed, and excellent overall agreement is observed between analytical and numerical predictions. The proposed method takes into account essential aspects such as transversely isotropic material properties, in-situ stress states and their effect on the interfacial frictional forces in the debonded interfaces, and thus provides a convenient way to evaluate the stress concentration factors in damaged filament-wound composites.

Both graphs are constructed by the exact enumeration of a two-dimensional square lattice of a frustrated spin glass with nearest-neighbor interactions up to the size of 27 spins. The enumeration of the energy-landscape minima as well as the analytical mean-field approximation show that these minima have a Gaussian distribution, and the connectivity graph has a log-Weibull degree distribution of shape $\u03ba=8.22$ and scale $\u03bb=4.84$. To study the effect of frustration on these results, we introduce an unfrustrated spin-glass model and demonstrate that the degree distribution of its connectivity graph shows a power-law behavior with the -3.46 exponent, which is similar to the behavior of proteins and Lennard-Jones clusters in its power-law form.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5403","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T05:31:07Z","registered":"2022-03-21T05:31:08Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T05:31:08Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In line with previous studies, we find that the gas at the centre of high-redshift minihaloes becomes chemothermally unstable as three-body reactions convert the atomic hydrogen into a fully molecular gas. The competition between the increasing rate at which the gas cools and the increasing optical depth to H2 line emission creates a characteristic dip in the cooling time over the free-fall time on a scale of 100 au. As a result, the free-fall time decreases to below the sound-crossing time, and the cloud may become gravitationally unstable and fragment on a scale of a few tens of au during the initial free-fall phase. In three of the nine haloes investigated, secondary clumps condense out of the parent cloud, which will likely collapse in their own right before they are accreted by the primary clump. In the other haloes, fragmentation at such an early stage is less likely. However, given that previous simulations have shown that the infall velocity decreases substantially once the gas becomes rotationally supported, the amount of time available for perturbations to develop may be much greater than is evident from the limited period of time simulated here.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS, simulation movie available at http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~tgreif","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0823","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T17:55:49Z","registered":"2022-03-11T17:55:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T17:55:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In contrast to conventional terahertz spectroscopy studies, this enables one to directly cover the frequency range encompassing the resultant plasma frequencies. The intensity reflection spectra of the thermalized plasma, measured using sum-frequency (up-conversion) detection of the probe pulses, can be modeled well by a standard Drude model with a density-dependent momentum scattering time of approx. 200 fs at low densities, reaching approx. 20 fs for densities of approx. 10^{19} cm^{-3}, where the increase of the scattering rate saturates. This behavior can be reproduced well with theoretical results based on the generalized Drude approach for the electron-hole scattering rate, where the saturation occurs due to phase-space restrictions as the plasma becomes degenerate. We also study the initial sub-picosecond temporal development of the Drude response, and discuss the observed rise in the scattering time in terms of initial charge-carrier relaxation, as well as the optical response of the photoexcited sample as predicted by finite-difference time-domain simulations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02829","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T17:46:03Z","registered":"2022-03-08T17:46:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T17:46:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The same holds in the case of finite-width electrodes if there is a \\emph{bottleneck} of one single site in the system electrode--molecule--electrode. Then, additional dephasing is necessary to induce spin-filtering effects. In contrast, nonzero spin polarization is found in molecular devices with multiple terminals or with two finite-width electrodes, each of them connected to more than one site of the molecule. Then, the magnitude of spin polarization can be enhanced by increasing the asymmetry between the two strands.

The synthetic stellar pop- ulations include both single stars and interacting binary stars. We compare these models to the observed emission lines of 254 HII regions of 13 nearby spiral galax- ies and 21 dwarf galaxies drawn from archival data. The models are created using the combination of the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (bpass) code with the photoionization code cloudy to study the differences caused by the inclusion of interacting binary stars in the stellar population. We obtain agreement with the observed emission line ratios from the nearby star-forming regions and discuss the effect of binary star evolution pathways on the nebular ionization of H II regions. We find that at population ages above 10 Myr, single-star models rapidly decrease in flux and ionization strength, while binary-star model still produce strong flux and high O III/H\\b{eta} ratios. Our models can reproduce the metallicity of H II regions from spiral galaxies but we find higher metallicities than previously estimated for the H II regions from dwarf galaxies. Comparing the equivalent width of H\\b{eta} emission between mod- els and observations, we find that accounting for ionizing photon leakage can affect age estimates for HII regions. When it is included, the typical age derived for HII regions is 5Myr from single-star models, and up to 10Myr with binary-star models. This is due to the existence of binary-star evolution pathways which produce more hot WR and helium stars at older ages. For future reference, we calculate new BPASS binary maximal starburst lines as a function of metallicity, and for the total model population, and present these in Appendix A.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"33 pages, 26 figures, accepted by MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07068","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T10:22:56Z","registered":"2022-03-03T10:22:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T10:22:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, due to the wide deployment of middleboxes in ISP networks, some important data, e.g., 5-tuples and flow statistics, are often obscured, rendering many existing approaches invalid. It is further challenged by the high-speed traffic of hundreds of terabytes per day in ISP networks. This paper proposes DeviceRadar, an online IoT device fingerprinting framework that achieves accurate, real-time processing in ISPs using programmable switches. We innovatively exploit \"key packets\" as a basis of fingerprints only using packet sizes and directions, which appear periodically while exhibiting differences across different IoT devices. To utilize them, we propose a packet size embedding model to discover the spatial relationships between packets. Meanwhile, we design an algorithm to extract the \"key packets\" of each device, and propose an approach that jointly considers the spatial relationships and the key packets to produce a neighboring key packet distribution, which can serve as a feature vector for machine learning models for inference. Last, we design a model transformation method and a feature extraction process to deploy the model on a programmable data plane within its constrained arithmetic operations and memory to achieve line-speed processing. Our experiments show that DeviceRadar can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across 77 IoT devices with 40 Gbps throughput, and requires only 1.3% of the processing time compared to GPU-accelerated approaches.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12738","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-04-22T01:40:17Z","registered":"2024-04-22T01:40:18Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-05-24T11:40:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We exploit sparse, real-time pressure inputs, combined with pre-trained transition networks, to estimate aerodynamic loads in unsteady and highly-separated flows. The transition networks contain the aerodynamic states of the system as nodes along with the underlying dynamics as links. A weighted average-based (WAB) strategy is proposed and tested on realistic experimental data on the flow around an accelerating elliptical plate at various angles-of-attack. Aerodynamic loads are then estimated for angles of attack cases not included in the training dataset so as to simulate the estimation process. An optimization process is also included to account for the system's temporal dynamics. Performance and limitations of the WAB approach are discussed, showing that transition networks can represent a versatile and effective data-driven tool for real-time signal estimation using sparse and noisy signals (such as surface pressure) in realistic flows.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04520","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T02:08:01Z","registered":"2022-02-23T02:08:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T02:08:02Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These measures target users engaged in discussions marked by hate speech or toxicity, often linked to specific keywords or hashtags. Nonetheless, the increasing prevalence of toxicity indicates that certain users adeptly circumvent these measures. This study examines consistently toxic users on Twitter (rebranded as X) Rather than relying on traditional methods based on specific topics or hashtags, we employ a novel approach based on patterns of toxic tweets, yielding deeper insights into their behavior. We analyzed 38 million tweets from the timelines of 12,148 Twitter users and identified the top 1,457 users who consistently exhibit toxic behavior, relying on metrics like the Gini index and Toxicity score. By comparing their posting patterns to those of non-consistently toxic users, we have uncovered distinctive temporal patterns, including contiguous activity spans, inter-tweet intervals (referred to as 'Burstiness'), and churn analysis. These findings provide strong evidence for the existence of a unique tweeting pattern associated with toxic behavior on Twitter. Crucially, our methodology transcends Twitter and can be adapted to various social media platforms, facilitating the identification of consistently toxic users based on their posting behavior. This research contributes to ongoing efforts to combat online toxicity and offers insights for refining moderation strategies in the digital realm. We are committed to open research and will provide our code and data to the research community.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14141","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2024-01-26T02:13:39Z","registered":"2024-01-26T02:13:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-01-26T02:13:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We present a continuation of our study about the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). In this work we extend the determination of metallicities up to redshift = 1.24 for a sample of 42 star-forming galaxies with a mean redshift value of 0.99. Methods. For a selected sample of emission-line galaxies, we use both diagnostic diagrams and empirical calibrations based on [OII] emission lines along with the empirical relation between the intensities of the [OIII] and [NeIII] emission lines and the theoretical ratios between Balmer recombination emission lines to identify star-forming galaxies and to derive their metallicities. We derive stellar masses by fitting the whole spectral energy distribution with a set of stellar population synthesis models. Results. These new methods allow us to extend the mass-metallicity relation to higher redshift. We show that the metallicity determinations are consistent with more established strong-line methods. Taken together this allows us to study the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z = 1.24 with good control of systematic uncertainties. We find an evolution with redshift of the average metallicity of galaxies very similar to those reported in the literature: for a given stellar mass, galaxies at z = 1 have, on average, a metallicity = 0.3 dex lower than galaxies in the local universe. However we do not see any significant metallicity evolution between redshifts z = 0.7 (Paper I) and z = 1.0 (this paper). We find also the same flattening of the mass-metallicity relation for the most massive galaxies as reported in Paper I at lower redshifts, but again no apparent evolution of the slope is seen between z = 0.7 and z = 1.0.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages and 8 figures.

By using not only the $c$-band dispersion but also the $f$-$c$ mixing matrix elements of the Wannier model, the realistic couplings for all 15 active multipole moments in $\u0393_8$ quartet subspace are obtained in the wavevector $q$-space and real-space. Both of the $\u0393_{5g}$ quadrupoles $(O_{yz},O_{zx},O_{xy})$ and the $\u0393_{2u}$ octupole $T_{xyz}$ couplings are maximally enhanced with $q=(\u03c0,\u03c0,\u03c0)$ which naturally explains the phase II of the antiferro-quadrupolar ordering at $T_{Q}=3.2$ K, and are also enhanced with $q=(0,0,0)$ corresponding to the elastic softening of $C_{44}$. Also the couplings of the $\u0393_{5u}$ octupoles $T_{x}^\u03b2$, $T_{y}^\u03b2$ and $T_{z}^\u03b2$ are quite large for $q=(\u03c0,0,0)$, $(0,\u03c0,0)$ and $(0,0,\u03c0)$, which yields the antiferro-octupolar ordering of a possible candidate for phase IV of Ce$_{x}$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$. The intersite vector dependence of the RKKY couplings exhibit different long-range, oscillating, isotropic and anisotropic behaviors depending on the types of the multipole moments. The present approach enables us to provide the information about the possible multipole ordering in an unbiased way and is easily available for other localized $f$ electron materials once the $c$ states and $f$-$c$ mixing elements are given from the bandstructure calculation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in J.

In the id-case, we find that the coupling to disorder renders the order parameter dynamics diffusive but otherwise leaves much of the phenomenology observed in the clean case intact. In contrast, the interplay of impurity scattering and order parameter fluctuations of is-symmetry entails the formation of a secondary superconductor transition, with a critical temperature exponentially sensitive to the disorder concentration.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4 pages, 2 figures included","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0210469","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T08:21:42Z","registered":"2022-03-19T08:21:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T08:21:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

NER exhibits a data imbalance with a long-tail distribution, featuring numerous minority classes (i.e., entity classes) and a single majority class (i.e., O-class). This imbalance leads to misclassifications of the entity classes as the O-class. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and effective learning method named majority or minority (MoM) learning. MoM learning incorporates the loss computed only for samples whose ground truth is the majority class into the loss of the conventional ML model. Evaluation experiments on four NER datasets (Japanese and English) showed that MoM learning improves prediction performance of the minority classes without sacrificing the performance of the majority class and is more effective than widely known and state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated MoM learning using frameworks as sequential labeling and machine reading comprehension, which are commonly used in NER. Furthermore, MoM learning has achieved consistent performance improvements regardless of language or framework.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables.

The saturated network appears in the form of droplets, which are heavier than water and sediment at the bottom of the vessel. In the case of Mg2+, the sedimented drops coalesce and form a separate multiconnected micellar phase - a supergiant surfactant micelle. For this phase, the rheological flow curves show Newtonian and shear-thinning regions. The appearance/disappearance of the Newtonian region marks the onset of formation of saturated network. The addition of small organic molecules (fragrances) to the multiconnected micellar phase leads to an almost spontaneous formation of oil-in-water nanoemulsion. The nanoemulsification capacity of the multiconnected micellar phase decreases with the rise of the volume of the oil molecule. A possible role of the network junctions in the nanoemulsification process can be anticipated. The properties of the multiconnected micellar phases could find applications in extraction and separation processes, in drug/active delivery, and for nanoemulsification at minimal energy input.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"32 pages, 9 figures; Supplementary Information: 7 pages, 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10494","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T11:50:56Z","registered":"2022-02-25T11:50:58Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T11:50:58Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Surprisingly, within the accessible time range, the ergodic phase shows subdiffusive behavior, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient vanishes throughout much of the phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit.

Spontaneous decay to the electromagnetic vacuum ultimately limits the interrogation time and thus sets a lower bound to the optimal frequency sensitivity. In dense ensembles of two-level systems the presence of collective effects such as superradiance and dipole-dipole interaction tends to decrease the sensitivity even further. We show that by a redesign of the Ramsey-pulse sequence to include different rotations of individual spins that effectively fold the collective state onto a state close to the center of the Bloch sphere, partial protection from collective decoherence and dephasing is possible. This allows a significant improvement in the sensitivity limit of a clock transition detection scheme over the conventional Ramsey method for interacting systems and even for non-interacting decaying atoms.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2558","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T15:46:45Z","registered":"2022-03-10T15:46:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T15:46:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This hypothesis is close, in certain respects, to the hypothesis of exchangeability, which postulates that the distribution of the observations is invariant with respect to their permutations. This paper reviews known methods of testing the two hypotheses concentrating on the online mode of testing, when the observations arrive sequentially. All known online methods for testing these hypotheses are based on conformal martingales, which are defined and studied in detail. The paper emphasizes conceptual and practical aspects and states two kinds of results. Validity results limit the probability of a false alarm or the frequency of false alarms for various procedures based on conformal martingales, including conformal versions of the CUSUM and Shiryaev-Roberts procedures. Efficiency results establish connections between randomness, exchangeability, and conformal martingales.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"34 pages, 1 table, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09256","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T10:00:04Z","registered":"2022-02-28T10:00:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T10:00:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Magnetic entropy extracted from the specific heat data is consistent with a $S=1/2$ degree of freedom per Cu$^{2+}$, and so is the effective moment extracted from DC-susceptibility. The ground state has been identified by means of neutron diffraction on both powder and single crystal and corresponds to a $\\sim120$ degree spin structure in which ferromagnetic intra-dimer alignment results in a net ferrimagnetic moment.

One key area is our development of basis function approaches that cast the theory as a Hamiltonian matrix problem while preserving a maximal set of symmetries. Regulating the theory with an external field that can be removed to obtain the continuum limit offers additional possibilities as seen in an application to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.

In the early universe, they are exposed to extreme conditions, including high temperature and rapid cosmic expansion. Understanding their behavior in this environment is crucial to understand the implications for cosmology. We calculate the finite temperature effective action for the field expectation value in two particularly important cases, for damped oscillations near the ground state and for scalar fields with a flat potential. We find that the behavior in both cases can in good approximation be described by a complex valued effective potential that yields Markovian equations of motion. Near the potential minimum, we recover the solution to the well-known Langevin equation. For large field values we find a very different behavior, and our result for the damping coefficient differs from the expressions frequently used in the literature. We illustrate our results in a simple scalar model, for which we give analytic approximations for the effective potential and damping coefficient. We also provide various expressions for loop integrals at finite temperature that are useful for future calculations in other models.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"34 pages plus appendix, 17 figures: minor corrections, modifications of discussions, added references, version published in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04444","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T16:38:41Z","registered":"2022-03-08T16:38:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T16:38:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Toward this end, we utilize a rate equation approach within a fireball model as previously employed for a wide range of heavy-ion collisions, adapted to the small systems in $p$-A collisions. The initial geometry of the fireball is taken from a Monte-Carlo event generator where initial anisotropies are caused by fluctuations. We calculate the centrality and transverse-momentum dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{p{\\rm A}}$) as well as elliptic flow ($v_2$) for both $J/\u03c8$ and $\u03c8(2S)$ and compare them to experimental data from RHIC and the LHC. While the $R_{p{\\rm A}}$s show an overall fair agreement with most of the data, the large $v_2$ values observed in $p$-Pb collisions at the LHC cannot be accounted for in our approach. While the former finding generally supports the formation of a near thermalized QCD medium in small systems, the discrepancy in the $v_2$ suggests that its large observed values are unlikely to be due to the final-state collectivity of the fireball alone.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 15 figures; version accepted for publication in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10014","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T03:53:22Z","registered":"2022-03-02T03:53:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T03:53:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Although the majority of boulders on Ryugu have reflectance spectra and albedo similar to the Ryugu average, a small fraction of boulders exhibit anomalously high albedo and distinctively different spectra. A previous study (Tatsumi et al., 2021) based on the 2.7-km observations and a series of low-altitude (down to 68 m) descent observations conducted prior to the first touchdown have shown that the spectra of these anomalous boulders can be classified into two distinct groups corresponding to S and C type asteroids. The former originate most likely from an impactor that collided with Ryugu's parent body, whereas the latter may be from portions of Ryugu's parent body that experienced a different temperature history than experienced by the majority of boulder materials. In this study, we analyzed images captured after the first touchdown to determine the quantitative properties of these bright boulders on Ryugu. We measured the sizes of more than a thousand bright boulders and characterized the morphologic properties of the largest ones. Analyses revealed many properties of bright boulders important for the evolution of Ryugu and its parent body. The size-frequency distributions of S- and C-type bright boulders follow power laws. We obtained the ratios of the total volume and surface area of S-type bright boulders to those of average dark boulders on the Ryugu surface. Also, many of the bright boulders are embedded in a larger substrate boulder, suggesting that they have experienced mixing and conglomeration with darker fragments on the parent body, rather than gently landing on Ryugu during or after its formation by reaccumulation. This is consistent with the hypothesis that S-type bright boulders were likely mixed during and/or before a catastrophic disruption.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 11 figures, 3 Tables, published in Icarus, 369, 15 November, 2021, 114529","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14974","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T13:24:12Z","registered":"2022-02-21T13:24:13Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T13:24:13Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this article, we use a dissimilarity measure based on the data cloud, called MADD, which takes care of this problem. MADD uses the distance concentration phenomenon to its advantage, and as a result, clustering algorithms based on MADD usually perform better for high dimensional data. Using theoretical and numerical results, we amply demonstrate it in this article. We also address the problem of estimating the number of clusters. This is a very challenging problem in cluster analysis, and several algorithms have been proposed for it. We show that many of these existing algorithms have superior performance in high dimensions when MADD is used instead of the Euclidean distance. We also construct a new estimator based on penalized Dunn index and prove its consistency in the HDLSS asymptotic regime, where the sample size remains fixed and the dimension grows to infinity. Several simulated and real data sets are analyzed to demonstrate the importance of MADD for cluster analysis of high dimensional data.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09121","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T01:33:14Z","registered":"2022-03-05T01:33:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T01:33:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This is a highly predictive 4D $SU(5)$ GUT with a flavor symmetry that does not contain a triplet irreducible representation. The Yukawa matrices of quarks and charged leptons are obtained after integrating out heavy messenger fields from renormalizable superpotentials while neutrino masses originate from the type I seesaw mechanism. The group theoretical factors from 24- and 45-dimensional Higgs fields lead to ratios between the Yukawa couplings in agreement with data, while the dangerous proton decay operators are highly suppressed. By performing a numerical fit, we find that the model captures accurately the mixing angles, the Yukawa couplings and the $CP$ phase of the quark sector at the GUT scale. The neutrino masses are generated at the renormalizable level with the prediction of trimaximal mixing while an additional effective operator is required to account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). The model is remarkably predictive because only the normal neutrino mass ordering and the lower octant of the atmospheric angle are allowed while the $CP$ conserving values of the Dirac neutrino phase $\u03b4_{CP}$ are excluded. Moreover, the predicted values of the effective Majorana mass $m_{\u03b2\u03b2}$ can be tested at future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. An analytical and a numerical study of the BAU via the leptogenesis mechanism is performed. We focused on the regions of parameter space where leptogenesis from the lightest right-handed neutrino is successfully realized. Strong correlations between the parameters of the neutrino sector and the observed BAU are obtained.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"39 pages, 28 figures, matches published version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07332","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T15:01:26Z","registered":"2022-02-23T15:01:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T15:01:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A temperature - pressure phase diagram is determined and the results suggest three different superconducting phases $\u03b1$, $\u03b2$, and $\u03b3$ in the studied pressure range. We further show that occurrence of the three superconducting phases is intuitively linked to phase transitions at higher temperature which are likely first order in nature. $T_p$, which separates phase $\u03b1$ from $\u03b2$ and $\u03b3$, is associated with an abrupt resistance change as pressure is increased from 0.27 GPa to 0.33 GPa. Above 0.33 GPa, an \"S-shape\" anomaly in the temperature-dependent resistance curve, $T_\\text S$, is observed and associated with the transition between the $\u03b2$ and $\u03b3$ phases. Further increasing of pressure above 1.05 GPa suppresses this transition and BaBi$_3$ stays in $\u03b3$ phase over the whole investigated temperature range. These high-temperature anomalies are likely related to structural degrees of freedom. With the $\u03b1$ phase being the ambient-pressure tetragonal structure ($P4/mmm$), our first-principle calculations suggest the $\u03b2$ phase to be cubic structure ($Pm-3m$) and the $\u03b3$ phase to be a distorted tetragonal structure where the Bi atoms are moved out of the face-centered position. Finally, an analysis of the evolution of the superconducting upper critical field with pressure further confirms these transitions in the superconducting state and suggests a possible change of band structure or a Lifshitz transition near 1.54 GPa in $\u03b3$ phase. Given the large atomic numbers of both Ba and Bi, our results establish BaBi$_3$ as a good candidate for the study of the interplay of structure with superconductivity in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 10 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10043","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T00:40:48Z","registered":"2022-03-02T00:40:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T00:40:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Users of these immersive technologies can explore and experience the stimuli in a more interactive and personalized way than previous technologies. Thus, considering the new technological challenges related to these systems and the new perceptual dimensions and interaction behaviors involved, a deep understanding of the users' Quality of Experience is required to satisfy their demands and expectations. In this sense, it is essential to foster the research on evaluating the QoE of immersive communication systems, since this will provide useful outcomes to optimize them and to identify the factors that can deteriorate the user experience. With this aim, subjective tests are usually performed following standard methodologies, which are designed for specific technologies and services. Although numerous user studies have been already published, there are no recommendations or standards that define common testing methodologies to be applied to evaluate immersive communication systems, such as those developed for images and video. Therefore, a revision of the QoE evaluation methods designed for previous technologies is required to develop robust and reliable methodologies for immersive communication systems. Thus, the objective of this paper is to provide an overview of existing immersive communication systems and related user studies, which can help on the definition of basic guidelines and testing methodologies to be used when performing user tests of immersive communication systems, such as 360-degree video-based telepresence, avatar-based social VR, cooperative AR, etc.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Frontiers in Signal Processing","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05953","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-05-13T01:01:22Z","registered":"2022-05-13T01:01:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-09-02T01:09:35Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints were observed by RHESSI for two minutes during the peak of the flare. Their locations coincided with the locations of the upflows in parts of the southern flare ribbon but the HXR footpoint source preceded the observation of upflows in FeXXI by 30-75 seconds. However, in other parts of the southern ribbon and in the northern ribbon the observed upflows were not coincident with a HXR source in time nor space, most prominently during the decay phase. In this case evaporation is likely caused by energy input via a conductive flux that is established between the hot (25 MK) coronal source, which is present during the whole observed time-interval, and the chromosphere. The presented observations suggest that conduction may drive evaporation not only during the decay phase but also during the flare peak. Electron beam heating may only play a role in driving evaporation during the initial phases of the flare.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 figures, ApJ, accepted","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09186","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T16:38:21Z","registered":"2022-03-07T16:38:22Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T16:38:22Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We show that in the high-occupancy regime of scalar dark matter, the Boltzmann collision integral does not describe either gravitaitonal or self-interactions, and derive kinetic equations valid for these interactions.

However, in a dense cluster environment star-disc systems do interact gravitationally. The aim here is to estimate the encounter-induced accretion rate in an ONC-like environment. Combining simulations of the cluster dynamics with simulations of the effect of encounters on star-disc systems we determine the likelihood and degree of encounter-triggered accretion processes. We show that accretion bursts triggered by encounters of star-disc systems are common in young dense clusters like the ONC leading in the outburst phase to typical accretion rates of 10^(-7)-10^(-4) M(sun)/yr. Up to a third of stars presently in the Trapezium region accreted at least 1% of their disc mass via this mechanism in the last 1Myr. Accretion of over 6-7% of the disc material can occur in a single encounter. Despite losing their discs quickly, the total percentage of disc matter accreted per star is largest for the massive stars. Supplementing the steady accretion flow there exist episodic periods of high accretion in dense cluster environments. Due to their high accretion rate these processes should be observable even now in some of the low-mass stars in the ONC.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4+2 pages, 3+1 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4256","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T23:33:47Z","registered":"2022-03-15T23:33:48Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T23:33:48Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We investigate the quasiparticle (QP) creation and thermalization dynamics of this system by solving the time-dependent Keldysh-Bogoliubov equations. We find avalanche-like QP creation due to a parametric resonance between BEC and QP oscillations, followed by slow, exponential relaxation to a thermal state at an elevated temperature, controlled by the initial excitation energy of the oscillating BEC above its ground state. The crossover between the two regimes occurs because of an effective decoupling of the QP and BEC oscillations. This dynamics is analogous to elementary particle creation in models of the early universe. The thermalization in our set-up occurs because the BEC acts as a grand canonical reservoir for the quasiparticle system.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 4 Figures, final version accepted for publication in Phys.

A straightforward adiabatic approximation turns out to adequately describe the properties of the system in this regime. Upon lowering the temperature the two potential energy minima of the oscillator merge to a single one at the equilibrium position of the uncoupled system. Using the parallels to the X-ray edge problem in metals we derive the oscillator partition function.

sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) swept across the world in early 2020, triggering the lockdowns of several billion people across many countries, including China, Spain, India, the U.K., Italy, France, Germany, and most states of the U.S. The transmission of the virus accelerated rapidly with the most confirmed cases in the U.S., and New York City became an epicenter of the pandemic by the end of March. In response to this national and global emergency, the NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center brought together a taskforce of international researchers and assembled implemented strategies to rapidly respond to this crisis, for supporting research, saving lives, and protecting the health of global citizens. This perspective paper presents our collective view on the global health emergency and our effort in collecting, analyzing, and sharing relevant data on global policy and government responses, geospatial indicators of the outbreak and evolving forecasts; in developing research capabilities and mitigation measures with global scientists, promoting collaborative research on outbreak dynamics, and reflecting on the dynamic responses from human societies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"27 pages, 18 figures.

Here we propose a new approach to find candidate counterparts for the UGSs based on the 325 MHz radio survey performed with Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the northern hemisphere. First we investigate the low-frequency radio properties of blazars, the largest known population of gamma-ray sources; then we search for sources with similar radio properties combining the information derived from the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) with those of the NRAO VLA Sky survey (NVSS). We present a list of candidate counterparts for 32 UGSs with at least one counterpart in the WENSS. We also performed an extensive research in literature to look for infrared and optical counterparts of the gamma-ray blazar candidates selected with the low-frequency radio observations to confirm their nature. On the basis of our multifrequency research we identify 23 new gamma-ray blazar candidates out of 32 UGSs investigated. Comparison with previous results on the UGSs are also presented. Finally, we speculate on the advantages on the use of the low-frequency radio observations to associate UGSs and to search for gamma-ray pulsar candidates.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, ApJS accepted for publication (version pre-proof corrections)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0330","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T14:27:33Z","registered":"2022-03-10T14:27:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T14:27:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our optimal estimator for g_NL is separable and can be efficiently computed in real space. Combining the exact filtering of CMB maps with the full covariance matrix, our method allows us to extract cosmological information from observed data as much as possible and obtain a tighter constraint on g_NL than previous studies. Applying our method to the WMAP 9-year data, we obtain the constraint g_NL = (-3.3 +- 2.2) 10^5, which is a few times tighter than previous ones. We also make a forecast for PLANCK data by using the Fisher matrix analysis.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 2 tables; Several tests are performed to validate the results; accepted for publication in JCAP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4626","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T08:05:56Z","registered":"2022-03-11T08:05:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T08:05:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, their reliance on data stored in a retrieval database, which may contain proprietary or sensitive information, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, an attacker may be able to infer whether a certain text passage appears in the retrieval database by observing the outputs of the RAG system, an attack known as a Membership Inference Attack (MIA). Despite the significance of this threat, MIAs against RAG systems have yet remained under-explored. This study addresses this gap by introducing an efficient and easy-to-use method for conducting MIA against RAG systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack using two benchmark datasets and multiple generative models, showing that the membership of a document in the retrieval database can be efficiently determined through the creation of an appropriate prompt in both black-box and gray-box settings. Moreover, we introduce an initial defense strategy based on adding instructions to the RAG template, which shows high effectiveness for some datasets and models. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing security countermeasures in deployed RAG systems and developing more advanced defenses to protect the privacy and security of retrieval databases.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20446","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-06-03T01:28:48Z","registered":"2024-06-03T01:28:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-03-10T02:31:13Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

By adopting a specific Ansatz for the $\u03be\u03bb$ term it is possible to determine that the behaviour of the Hubble parameter in Rastall gravity has a similar aspect to the $\u039b$CDM model at late times, but at thermodynamics level differs from the standard cosmology since the adiabatic behaviour for the entropy depends on the value of the parameter state, $\u03c9$. However, the entropy has a positive growth and simultaneously its convexity condition can be guaranteed; when other contributions are considered such as matter production and chemical potential, the adiabatic expansion can not be achieved, but the theory keeps its thermodynamics consistency. The chemical potential seems to have an interesting role since at effective level we could have a cosmological constant or phantom expansion in the model.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 2 figures, accepted version in CQG","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11945","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T10:09:36Z","registered":"2022-02-28T10:09:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T10:09:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Assessing pregnancy health often relies on diagnostic markers such as the labyrinth zone (LZ) proportion within the placenta. This study aimed to investigate the impact of disrupted circadian rhythms on placental health and fetal development using animal models. Methods and Results: Employing unstained photo-acoustic microscopy (PAM) and hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained images, we found them mutually reinforcing. Our images revealed the role of MCRD on the LZ and fetus weight: a decrease in LZ area from 5.01-HE(4.25-PAM) mm2 to 3.58-HE (2.62-PAM) mm2 on day 16 and 6.48-HE(5.16-PAM) mm2 to 4.61-HE (3.03-PAM) mm2 on day 18, resulting in 0.71 times lower fetus weights. We have discriminated a decrease in the mean LZ to placenta area ratio from 64% to 47% on day 18 in mice with disrupted circadian rhythms with PAM. Discussion: The study highlights the negative influence of circadian rhythm disruption on placental development and fetal well-being. Reduced LZ area and fetal weights in the MCRD group suggest compromised placental function under disrupted circadian rhythms. PAM imaging proved to be an efficient technique for assessing placental development, offering advantages over traditional staining methods. These findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying circadian disruption's effects on reproductive health and fetal development, emphasizing the importance of maintaining normal circadian rhythms for optimal pregnancy outcomes. Further research is needed to explore interventions to mitigate these effects and improve pregnancy outcomes.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04694","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-11-08T03:01:18Z","registered":"2024-11-08T03:01:19Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-11-08T03:01:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Much attention has been devoted to the monolayer limit, but the monolayer channel is not necessarily advantageous in terms of the performance of field-effect transistors (FETs). Therefore, it is important to investigate the characteristics of FETs that have multilayer channels. Here, we report the staircase-like transfer characteristics of FETs with exfoliated multilayer MoS2 flakes. Atomic force microscope characterizations reveal that the presence of thinner terraces at the edges of the flakes accompanies the staircase-like characteristics. The anomalous staircase-like characteristics are ascribable to a difference in threshold-voltage shift by charge transfer from surface adsorbates between the channel center and the thinner terrace at the edge. This study reveals the importance of the uniformity of channel thickness.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13723","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T14:11:33Z","registered":"2022-02-25T14:11:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T14:11:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Well known examples include supernovae and novae. A byproduct of the Deep Lens Survey was the discovery of three transients which varied on a timescale of less than an hour. All three had faint and red counterparts, the brightest of which was identified with an M star. However, the remaining two showed hints of an extragalactic origin, one had a spatially extended counterpart and the other appeared in projection on the outskirts of a bright elliptical galaxy. If these two sources were really of an extragalactic origin then the two events represent a new class of exotic explosive transients. We undertook spectroscopic observations with the Keck telescope and find the two counterparts are also late type Galactic dwarfs. Our main conclusion is that flares from M dwarfs constitute a dense foreground fog and dominate over any plausible class of extragalactic fast transients by at least two orders of magnitude. Overcoming this fog will likely require dedicated surveys with careful optimization of target field location, filter(s) and cadence, pre-search imaging to filter out late type dwarfs and a well planned rapid followup plan.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4 pages, 2 figures, ApJL in press, referee's comments implemented","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604343","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T21:44:39Z","registered":"2022-03-16T21:44:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T21:44:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Furthermore, the dynamic control of the quantum dot energy via electric fields allows the freezing of the light-matter interaction leaving the quantum dot in its excited state. Shaping of single photon wavepackets by the electric field control is limited by the occurrence of chirping of the single photon pulse.

Current research in neuromorphic hardware targets dramatic improvements to ANN performance by increasing energy efficiency, speed of operation, and even seeks to extend the utility of ANNs by natively adding functionality such as spiking operation. One promising neuromorphic hardware platform is based on superconductive electronics, which has the potential to incorporate all of these advantages at the device level in addition to offering the potential of near lossless communications both within the neuromorphic circuits as well as between disparate superconductive chips. Here we explore one of the fundamental brain-inspired architecture components, the fan-in and fan-out as realized in superconductive circuits based on Josephson junctions. From our calculations and WRSPICE simulations we find that the fan-out should be limited only by junction count and circuit size limitations, and we demonstrate results in simulation at a level of 1-to-10,000, similar to that of the human brain. We find that fan-in has more limitations, but a fan-in level on the order of a few 100-to-1 should be achievable based on current technology. We discuss our findings and the critical parameters that set the limits on fan-in and fan-out in the context of superconductive neuromorphic circuits.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages 10 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06409","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T08:15:56Z","registered":"2022-02-25T08:15:58Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T08:15:58Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Both situations where the rotation speed is either non-resonant or trapped in a p:1 spin-orbit resonance where p is a half integer are addressed. The rotation dynamics is described by the Poincar\u00e9-Hough model which assumes a simple motion of the core. The problem is written in a non-canonical Hamiltonian formalism. The secular evolution is obtained without any truncation in obliquity, eccentricity nor inclination. The condition for the body to be in a Cassini state is written as a set of two equations whose unknowns are the mantle obliquity and the tilt angle of the core spin-axis. Solving the system with Mercury's physical and orbital parameters leads to a maximum of 16 different equilibrium configurations, half of them being spectrally stable. In most of these solutions the core is highly tilted with respect to the mantle. The model is also applied to Io and the Moon.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages, 3 figures.

It is not known whether core He-burning WR stars (classical WR, cWR) form predominantly through wind-stripping (w-WR) or binary stripping (b-WR). With spectroscopy of WR binaries so-far largely avoided due to its complexity, our study focuses on the 44 WR binaries / binary candidates of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, metallicity Z~0.5 Zsun), identified on the basis of radial velocity variations, composite spectra, or high X-ray luminosities. Relying on a diverse spectroscopic database, we aim to derive the physical and orbital parameters of our targets, confronting evolution models of evolved massive stars at sub-solar metallicity, and constraining the impact of binary interaction in forming them. Spectroscopy is performed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code and cross-correlation techniques. Disentanglement is performed using the code Spectangular or the shift-and-add algorithm. Evolutionary status is interpreted using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code, exploring binary interaction and chemically-homogeneous evolution. No obvious dichotomy in the locations of apparently-single and binary WN stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is apparent. According to commonly used stellar evolution models (BPASS, Geneva), most apparently-single WN stars could not have formed as single stars, implying that they were stripped by an undetected companion. Otherwise, it must follow that pre-WR mass-loss/mixing (e.g., during the red supergiant phase) are strongly underestimated in standard stellar evolution models.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted to A&amp;A on 10.05.2019; 69 pages (25 main paper + 44 appendix); Corrigendum: Shenar et al. 2020, A&amp;A, 641, 2: An unfortunate typo in the implementation of the \"transformed radius\" caused errors of up to ~0.5dex in the derived mass-loss rates.

A single, dominant modefunction describes the dynamics for arbitrary control pulse shapes. Complete transfer of the quantum state of the incident photon to a collective dark state within the ensemble can be achieved by shaping the control pulse so as to match the dominant mode to the temporal mode of the photon.

We find the transition radius between the relative dominance of the inner-halo and outer-halo stellar populations to be ~15-20 kpc for most of our haloes, similar to that inferred for the Milky Way from recent observations. While the number density of stars in the simulated inner-halo populations decreases rapidly with distance, the outer-halo populations contribute about 20-40 per cent in the fiducial solar neighborhood, in particular at the lowest metallicities. We have determined [Fe/H] profiles for our simulated haloes; they exhibit flat or mild gradients, in the range [-0.002, -0.01 ] dex/kpc. The metallicity distribution functions exhibit different features, reflecting the different assembly history of the individual stellar haloes. We find that stellar haloes formed with larger contributions from massive subgalactic systems have steeper metallicity gradients. Very metal-poor stars are mainly contributed to the halo systems by lower-mass satellites. There is a clear trend among the predicted metallicity distribution functions that a higher fraction of low-metallicity stars are found with increasing radius. These properties are consistent with the range of behaviours observed for stellar haloes of nearby galaxies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 6 figures. Accepted MNRAS.

Despite the origin of those correlations is unknown, this could be attributed to direct or indirect physical relations between the emission line formation and the accretion mechanism. This work shows that all (near-UV/optical/near-IR) L_acc-L_line correlations are the result of the fact that the accretion luminosity and the stellar luminosity (L_star) are correlated, and are not necessarily related with the physical origin of the line. Synthetic and observational data are used to illustrate how the L_acc-L_line correlations depend on the L_acc-L_star relationship. We conclude that because PMS stars show the L_acc-L_star correlation immediately implies that L_acc also correlates with the luminosity of all emission lines, for which the L_acc-L_line correlations alone do not prove any physical connection with accretion but can only be used with practical purposes to roughly estimate accretion rates. When looking for correlations with possible physical meaning, we suggest that L_acc/L_star and L_line/L_star should be used instead of L_acc and L_line. Finally, the finding that L_acc has a steeper dependence on L_star for T-Tauri stars than for intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be stars is also discussed. That is explained from the magnetospheric accretion scenario and the different photospheric properties in the near-UV.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Using optical spectroscopy from the SOAR telescope, we have identified a late-G giant in an eccentric ($e$ = 0.06) 8.133 day orbit with an invisible primary. Modeling the spectroscopy and photometry together lead us to infer a heavy neutron star primary of $\\sim 2 M_{\\odot}$ and a partially stripped giant secondary of $\\sim 0.8 M_{\\odot}$. H$\u03b1$ emission is observed in some of the spectra, perhaps consistent with the presence of a faint accretion disk. We find the $\u03b3$-ray flux of 2FGL J0846.0+2820 dropped substantially in mid-2009, accompanied by an increased variation in the optical brightness, and since then it has not been detected by \\emph{Fermi}. The long period and giant secondary are reminiscent of the $\u03b3$-ray bright binary 1FGL J1417.7--4407, which hosts a millisecond pulsar apparently in the final stages of the pulsar recycling process. The discovery of 2FGL J0846.0+2820 suggests the identification of a new subclass of millisecond pulsar binaries that are the likely progenitors of typical field millisecond pulsars.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

This proposed technique is termed Polymer on Polymer Pollutant Removal (PoPPR), which utilizes the elastic properties of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to physically remove contaminants from contact lens surfaces through non-adhesive unpeeling. Methods: Three different ratios of setting agent to polymer PDMS (1:30, 1:40, and 1:50) were evaluated using the PoPPR method against the control method of RR with a commercial multi-purpose lens cleaning solution. Three simulated pollutants of different sizes: pollen (25-40 \u03bcm), microbeads (1-5 \u03bcm), and nanoparticles (5-10 nm), were used to test the effectiveness of both cleaning methods. The fraction of pollutants removed from each contact lens was recorded and evaluated for significance. Results: PDMS 1:40 was found to be the optimal ratio for lens cleaning using the PoPPR method. For larger particles (&gt;10 \u03bcm), no difference was observed between conventional RR and proposed PoPPR method (p &gt; 0.05). However, the new PoPPR technique was significantly better at removing small PM2.5 particles (&lt;2.5 \u03bcm) compared to the RR method, specifically for microbeads (p = 0.006) and nanoparticles (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This proof-of-concept work demonstrates that the PoPPR method of cleaning contact lenses is as effective as the conventional cleaning method for larger particles such as pollen. The PoPPR method is more effective at removing extremely fine particulate pollutants, including microplastics and nanoparticles. This method offers a potentially more efficient cleaning protocol that could enhance the safety, health, and comfort of contact lens users, especially those living in regions with significant air pollution.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08732","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T10:08:26Z","registered":"2022-02-25T10:08:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T10:08:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We argue that this measurement will be key to future QCD global analyses, so it should inform EIC detector designs and luminosity requirements.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables; added new plots showing PDF error bands in s(x,Q) and Rs(x,Q) to illustrate range of uncertainty on these quantities","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12520","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T08:23:07Z","registered":"2022-02-25T08:23:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T08:23:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, the interpretations of the experimental results are very controversial. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy supported by the first-principles calculations, we probe the tilted Weyl cone bands in the bulk electronic structure of WP2 directly, which are at the origin of Fermi arcs at the surfaces and transport properties related to the chiral anomaly in type-II WSMs. Our results ascertain that due to the spin-orbit coupling the Weyl nodes originate from the splitting of 4-fold degenerate band-crossing points with Chern numbers C = $\\pm$2 induced by the crystal symmetries of WP2, which is unique among all the discovered WSMs. Our finding also provides a guiding line to observe the chiral anomaly which could manifest in novel transport properties.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03523","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T19:57:49Z","registered":"2022-02-27T19:57:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T19:57:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The propagation environment at such high frequencies, however, introduces challenges throughout the whole protocol stack design, from physical layer signal processing to application design. Therefore, it is fundamental to develop a holistic understanding of the channel propagation and fading characteristics over realistic deployment scenarios and ultra-wide bands. In this paper, we conduct an extensive measurement campaign to evaluate the impact of weather conditions on a wireless link in the 130-150 GHz band through a channel sounding campaign with clear weather, rain, and snow in a typical urban backhaul scenario. We present a novel channel sounder design that captures signals with -82 dBm sensitivity and 20 GHz of bandwidth. We analyze link budget, capacity, as well as channel parameters such as the delay spread and the K-factor. Our experimental results indicate that in the considered context the adverse weather does not interrupt the link, but introduces some additional constraints (e.g., high delay spread and increase in path loss in snow conditions) that need to be accounted for in the design of reliable Sixth Generation (6G) communication links above 100 GHz.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"P.

An increase of the electronic heat capacity at the transition from the NMI state to the FL state which keeps the triangular dimer lattice demonstrates that the charge sector lost in the Mott insulating state is recovered in the FL state. We observed that the remaining low-energy spin excitations in the Mott insulating state show unique temperature dependence, and that the NMI state has a larger lattice entropy originating from the frustrated lattice, which leads to the Pomeranchuk-like effect on the electron localization. Near the Mott boundary, an unexpected enhancement and magnetic-field dependence of heat capacity are observed.

Performing particle-in-cell simulations, we study the injection of protons into DSA and the early development of a nonthermal particle population in weak shocks in high $\u03b2$ ($\\approx 100$) plasmas. Reflection of incident protons, self-excitation of plasma waves via CR-driven instabilities, and multiple cycles of shock drift acceleration are essential to the early acceleration of CR protons in supercritical quasi-parallel shocks. We find that only in ICM shocks with $M_{\\rm s} \\gtrsim M_{\\rm s}^*\\approx 2.25$, a sufficient fraction of incoming protons are reflected by the overshoot in the shock electric potential and magnetic mirror at locally perpendicular magnetic fields, leading to efficient excitation of magnetic waves via CR streaming instabilities and the injection into the DSA process. Since a significant fraction of ICM shocks have $M_{\\rm s} &lt; M_{\\rm s}^*$, CR proton acceleration in the ICM might be less efficient than previously expected. This may explain why the diffuse gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters due to proton-proton collisions has not been detected so far.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"To appear in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09403","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T00:57:45Z","registered":"2022-03-02T00:57:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T00:57:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We have cross-matched to sources in the 2MASS catalogue so that for all stars individually determined Near Infrared photometry (NIR) is available on a homogeneous system (typically K_s). The spatial completeness of the sample has been carefully determined by statistical methods, and the NIR luminosity function of the stars has been derived by direct star counts. We find a local volume luminosity of 0.121 +/- 0.004 L_K_sun/(pc**3), corresponding to a volumetric mass-to-light ratio of M/L_K = 0.31 +/- 0.02 M_sun/L_K_sun, where giants contribute 80 per cent to the light but less than 2 per cent to the stellar mass. We derive the surface brightness of the solar cylinder with the help of a vertical disc model. We find a surface brightness of 99 L_K_sun/(pc**2) with an uncertainty of approximately 10 %. This corresponds to a mass-to-light ratio for the solar cylinder of M/L_K = 0.34 M_sun/L_K_sun. The mass-to-light ratio for the solar cylinder is only 10% larger than the local value despite the fact that the local population has a much larger contribution of young stars. It turns out that the effective scale heights of the lower main sequence carrying most of the mass is similar to that of the giants, which are dominating the NIR light. The corresponding colour for the solar cylinder is V-K=2.89 mag compared to the local value of V-K = 2.46 mag. An extrapolation of the local surface brightness to the whole Milky Way yields a total luminosity of M_K = -24.2 mag. The Milky Way falls in the range of K band Tully-Fisher (TF) relations from the literature.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 11 figures, accepted to MNRAS.

This type of delay is frequency-dependent and is usually used for estimating the projected number density of electrons along the line of sight, called the dispersion measure. The dense and clumpy distribution of plasma can cause refractive deflections of radio signals, analogous to lensing effects. Similar to gravitational lensing, there are two contributions to the time delay effect in plasma lensing: a geometric delay, due to increased path length of the signal, and a dispersive delay due to the change of speed of light in a plasma medium. We show the delay time for two models of the plasma distribution, and point out that the estimated dispersion measure can be biased. Since the contribution of the geometric effect can be comparable to that of the dispersive delay, the bias in the measured dispersion measure can be dramatically large if plasma lensing effects are not taken into account when signals propagate through a high-density gradient clump of plasma.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"comments welcome","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02100","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T19:57:11Z","registered":"2022-02-26T19:57:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T19:57:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We used the VLSS catalog as a sky model to correct the ionospheric distortions in the data and create a new set of sky maps and corresponding catalog at 73.8 MHz. The VLSS Redux (VLSSr) has a resolution of 75 arcsec, and an average map RMS noise level of $\u03c3\\sim0.1$ Jy beam$^{-1}$. The clean bias is $0.66\\times\u03c3$, and the theoretical largest angular size is 36 arcmin. Six previously un-imaged fields are included in the VLSSr, which has an unbroken sky coverage over 9.3 sr above an irregular southern boundary. The final catalog includes 92,964 sources. The VLSSr improves upon the original VLSS in a number of areas including imaging of large sources, image sensitivity, and clean bias; however the most critical improvement is the replacement of an inaccurate primary beam correction which caused source flux errors which vary as a function of radius to nearest pointing center in the VLSS.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in the MNRAS.

Such structural similarity is often explained by generative processes. This paper describes the recent development of probabilistic generative models (PGMs) for language learning and symbol emergence in robotics. Symbol emergence in robotics aims to develop a robot that can adapt to real-world environments and human linguistic communications and acquire language from sensorimotor information alone (i.e., in an unsupervised manner). This is regarded as a constructive approach to symbol emergence systems. To this end, a series of PGMs have been developed, including those for simultaneous phoneme and word discovery, lexical acquisition, object and spatial concept formation, and the emergence of a symbol system. By extending the models, a symbol emergence system comprising a multi-agent system in which a symbol system emerges is revealed to be modeled using PGMs. In this model, symbol emergence can be regarded as collective predictive coding. This paper expands on this idea by combining the theory that ''emotion is based on the predictive coding of interoceptive signals'' and ''symbol emergence systems,'' and describes the possible hypothesis of the emergence of meaning in music.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15721","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2025-01-28T04:09:05Z","registered":"2025-01-28T04:09:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-01-28T04:09:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Assuming that this trend continues up to the highest energies observed by the Auger surface detectors we derive the constraints this places on the local source distribution of UHE CR nuclei. Utilizing an analytic description of UHE CR propagation we derive the expected spectra and composition for a wide range of source emission spectra. We find that sources of intermediate-to-heavy nuclei are consistent with the observed spectra and composition data above the ankle. This consistency requires the presence of nearby sources within 60 Mpc and 80 Mpc for silicon and iron only sources, respectively. The necessity of these local sources becomes even more compelling in the presence nano-Gauss local extragalactic magnetic fields.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 8 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.2055","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T23:35:11Z","registered":"2022-03-12T23:35:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T23:35:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

With a L_12mic/L_B ratio of 2.15, the galaxy is unexpectedly bright in the mid-infrared for such a low-metallicity object. The mid-infrared spectrum shows no sign of the Unidentified Infrared Bands, which we interpret as an effect of the destruction of their carriers by the very high UV energy density in SBS 0335-052. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is dominated by a very strong continuum which makes the ionic lines of [SIV] and [NeIII] very weak. From 5 to 17 mic, the SED can be fitted with a grey-body spectrum, modified by an extinction law similar to that observed toward the Galactic Center, with an optical depth of A_V~19-21 mag. Such a large optical depth implies that a large fraction (as much as ~ 75%) of the current star-formation activity in SBS 0335-052 is hidden by dust with a mass between 3x10^3 M_sun and 5x10^5 M_sun. Silicate grains are present as silicate extinction bands at 9.7 and 18 mic can account for the unusual shape of the MIR spectrum of SBS 0335-052. It is remarkable that such a nearly primordial environment contains as much dust as galaxies which are 10 times more metal-rich. If the hidden star formation in SBS 0335-052 is typical of young galaxies at high redshifts, then the cosmic star formation rate derived from UV/optical fluxes would be underestimated.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 4 figures, requires aaspp4.sty, accepted in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811126","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T14:41:03Z","registered":"2022-03-20T14:41:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T14:41:04Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In a wide binary, each galaxy possesses individual tangential, nearly astroidal, caustics and roundish radial caustics. As the separation of the binary is made smaller, the caustics undergo a sequence of metamorphoses. The first metamorphosis occurs when the tangential caustics merge to form a single six-cusped caustic, lying interior to the radial caustics. At still smaller separations, the six-cusped caustic undergoes the second metamorphosis and splits into a four-cusped caustic and two three-cusped caustics, which shrink to zero size (an elliptic umbilic catastrophe) before they enlarge again and move away from the origin perpendicular to the binary axis. Finally, a third metamorphosis occurs as the three-cusp caustics join the radial caustics, leaving an inner distorted astroid caustic enclosed by two outer caustics. The maximum number of images possible is 7. Classifying the multiple imaging according to critical isochrones, there are only 8 possibilities: 2 three-image cases, 3 five-image cases, and 3 seven-image cases. When the isothermal spheres are singular, the core images vanish into the central singularity. The number of images may then be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, depending on the source location, and the separation and masses of the pair of lensing galaxies. The locations of metamorphoses, and the onset of threefold and fivefold multiple imaging, can be worked out analytically in this case.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"MNRAS, in press","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3743","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T08:27:32Z","registered":"2022-03-16T08:27:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T08:27:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, it is counterintuitive that SOIs can exist for sound, which is a longitudinal wave that carries no intrinsic spin. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that airborne sound can possess artificial transversality in an acoustic micropolar metamaterial and thus carry both spin and orbital angular momentum. This enables the realization of acoustic SOIs with rich phenomena beyond those in conventional acoustic systems. We demonstrate that acoustic activity of the metamaterial can induce coupling between the spin and linear crystal momentum k, which leads to negative refraction of the transverse sound. In addition, we show that the scattering of the transverse sound by a dipole particle can generate spin-dependent acoustic vortices via the geometric phase effect. The acoustic SOIs can provide new perspectives and functionalities for sound manipulations beyond the conventional scalar degree of freedom and may open an avenue to the development of spin-orbit acoustics.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages, 8 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13558","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-22T05:35:22Z","registered":"2022-02-22T05:35:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-22T05:35:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

One proposed approach, the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method, rests on strong physical foundations and offers simple yet accurate and robust functionals. A very recent functional within this method called vdW-DF-cx [K. Berland and P. Hyldgaard, Phys. Rev. B 89, 035412] stands out in its attempt to use an exchange energy derived from the same plasmon-based theory from which the nonlocal correlation energy was derived. Encouraged by its good performance for solids, layered materials, and aromatic molecules, we apply it to several systems that are characterized by competing interactions. These include the ferroelectric response in PbTiO$_3$, the adsorption of small molecules within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the graphite/diamond phase transition, and the adsorption of an aromatic-molecule on the Ag(111) surface. Our results indicate that vdW-DF-cx is overall well suited to tackle these challenging systems. In addition to being a competitive density functional for sparse matter, the vdW-DF-cx construction presents a more robust general purpose functional that could be applied to a range of materials problems with a variety of competing interactions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0797","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T03:18:46Z","registered":"2022-03-10T03:18:48Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T03:18:48Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this paper, we propose the use of error-control codes and decoding algorithms to design crowdsourcing systems for reliable classification despite unreliable crowd workers. Coding-theory based techniques also allow us to pose easy-to-answer binary questions to the crowd workers. We consider three different crowdsourcing models: systems with independent crowd workers, systems with peer-dependent reward schemes, and systems where workers have common sources of information. For each of these models, we analyze classification performance with the proposed coding-based scheme. We develop an ordering principle for the quality of crowds and describe how system performance changes with the quality of the crowd. We also show that pairing among workers and diversification of the questions help in improving system performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coding-based scheme using both simulated data and real datasets from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing microtask platform. Results suggest that use of good codes may improve the performance of the crowdsourcing task over typical majority-voting approaches.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 11 figures, under revision, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3330","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T20:10:51Z","registered":"2022-03-10T20:10:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T20:10:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of the high transition temperature (Tc) superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d show that samples with different Tcs in the low doping regime follow a remarkably universal d-wave low energy excitation spectrum, indicating a doping independent nodal gap. We demonstrate that Tc instead correlates with the fraction of the Fermi surface over which the samples exhibit the universal spectrum. Optimal Tc is achieved when all parts of the Fermi surface follow this universal behavior.

The analysis is based on the BCS-like pairing theory combined with the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation, which first enables us to incorporate the state-filling effect, the band-gap renormalization and the strong/weak electron-hole pair correlations in a unified manner. We show that the electron-hole BCS state is distinctly stabilized by the intense pump-light, and this result strongly suggests that the macroscopic quantum state can be observed under the strong photoexcitation. The calculated spectra considerably deviate from results given by the BCS-like mean field theory and the simple BS equation without electron-hole pair correlation especially in the intermediate density states between the electron-hole BCS state and the excitonic BEC state. In particular, we find the sharp stimulated emission and absorption lines which originate from the optical transition accompanied by the collective phase fluctuation mode in the electron-hole BCS state.

Previous research has shown that such oscillations can emerge if the interaction network has small-world properties, and more generally, because of long-range interactions among individuals or because of mobility. But although these features are all common in nature, global oscillations are rarely observed in actual biological systems. This begets the question what is the missing ingredient that would prevent local oscillations to synchronize across the population to form global oscillations. Here we show that, although heterogeneous species-specific invasion rates fail to have a noticeable impact on species coexistence, randomness in site-specific invasion rates successfully hinders the emergence of global oscillations and thus preserves biodiversity. Our model takes into account that the environment is often not uniform but rather spatially heterogeneous, which may influence the success of microscopic dynamics locally. This prevents the synchronization of locally emerging oscillations, and ultimately results in a phenomenon where one type of randomness is used to mitigate the adverse effects of other types of randomness in the system.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 two-column pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in Scientific Reports","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05854","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T21:52:56Z","registered":"2022-03-05T21:52:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T21:52:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Applying our lensing-optimized data reduction, principal component interpolation for the ACS PSF, and improved modelling of charge-transfer inefficiency, we measure a lensing signal which is consistent with pure gravitational modes and no significant shape systematics. We carefully estimate the statistical uncertainty from simulated COSMOS-like fields obtained from ray-tracing through the Millennium Simulation. We test our pipeline on simulated space-based data, recalibrate non-linear power spectrum corrections using the ray-tracing, employ photometric redshifts to reduce potential contamination by intrinsic galaxy alignments, and marginalize over systematic uncertainties. We find that the lensing signal scales with redshift as expected from General Relativity for a concordance LCDM cosmology, including the full cross-correlations between different redshift bins. For a flat LCDM cosmology, we measure sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^0.51=0.75+-0.08 from lensing, in perfect agreement with WMAP-5, yielding joint constraints Omega_m=0.266+0.025-0.023, sigma_8=0.802+0.028-0.029 (all 68% conf.). Dropping the assumption of flatness and using HST Key Project and BBN priors only, we find a negative deceleration parameter q_0 at 94.3% conf. from the tomographic lensing analysis, providing independent evidence for the accelerated expansion of the Universe. For a flat wCDM cosmology and prior w in [-2,0], we obtain w","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"26 pages, 25 figures, matches version accepted for publication by Astronomy and Astrophysics","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0053","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T14:55:01Z","registered":"2022-03-15T14:55:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T14:55:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We do this via three methods of analysis, investigating: the merger fraction of AGN, the AGN fraction of merging systems and the AGN fraction of galaxies with close companions. In each case, we find an increased abundance of AGN within merging systems relative to control samples of inactive or isolated galaxies (by up to a factor of $\\approx 3$ depending on the analysis method used), confirming that mergers are enhancing BH accretion rates for at least a subset of the galaxy population. The greatest excess of AGN triggered via a merger are found in lower mass ($M_* \\sim 10^{10}$~\\Msol) gas rich ($f_{\\mathrm{gas}} &gt; 0.2$) central galaxies with lower mass BHs ($M_{\\mathrm{BH}} \\sim 10^{7}$~\\Msol) at lower redshifts ($z&lt;1$).

The enhancement of AGN is not uniform throughout the phases of a merger, and instead peaks within the early \\emph{remnants} of merging systems (typically lagging $\\approx 300$~Myr post-coalescence of the two galaxies at $z=0.5$).

Based on an initial coherent state representation of bath oscillators and an equilibrium canonical distribution of quantum mechanical mean values of their co-ordinates and momenta we have derived a $c$-number generalized quantum Langevin equation. The approach allows us to implement the method of classical non-Markovian Brownian motion to realize an exact generalized non-Markovian quantum Kramers' equation. The equation is valid for arbitrary temperature and friction. We have solved this equation in the spatial diffusion-limited regime to derive quantum Kramers' rate of barrier crossing and analyze its variation as a function of temperature and friction. While almost all the earlier theories rest on quasi-probability distribution functions (like Wigner function) and path integral methods, the present work is based on {\\it true probability distribution functions} and is independent of path integral techniques. The theory is a natural extension of the classical theory to quantum domain and provides a unified description of thermal activated processes and tunneling.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"RevTex, 18 pages, 2 figures; Minor corrections; To appear in Phys.

This is achieved by introducing only four new fields: a vectorlike quark, a vectorlike lepton, and two scalar fields (a singlet and a doublet) that mix due to the electroweak symmetry breaking and provide the dark matter candidate. The singlet-doublet mixing induces chirally-enhanced dipole transitions, which are crucial for the explanation of the muon g-2 discrepancy and the large charm CP violation, and allows to achieve the observed dark matter density in wide regions of the parameter space.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages plus appendices, 10 figures; v2: references added, discussion improved; v3: discussions on Landau poles and EWPOs added, conclusions unchanged, version to appear in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02676","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T10:26:09Z","registered":"2022-02-27T10:26:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T10:26:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Quantum key distribution (QKD) features fundamentally proven security and offers a promising option for quantum-proof cryptography solution. Although prototype QKD systems over optical fiber have been demonstrated over the years, the key generation rates remain several orders-of-magnitude lower than current classical communication systems. In an effort towards a commercially viable QKD system with improved key generation rates, we developed a discrete-variable QKD system based on time-bin quantum photonic states that is capable of generating provably-secure cryptographic keys at megabit-per-second (Mbps) rates over metropolitan distances. We use high-dimensional quantum states that transmit more than one secret bit per received photon, alleviating detector saturation effects in the superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) employed in our system that feature very high detection efficiency (of over 70%) and low timing jitter (of less than 40 ps). Our system is constructed using commercial off-the-shelf components, and the adopted protocol can readily be extended to free-space quantum channels. The security analysis adopted to distill the keys ensures that the demonstrated protocol is robust against coherent attacks, finite-size effects, and a broad class of experimental imperfections identified in our system.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06135","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T18:39:31Z","registered":"2022-03-03T18:39:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T18:39:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

I consider how the detectability scales with urbanization fraction: from Earth's value of 0.05%, up to the limiting case of an ecumenopolis -- or planet-wide city. Though an Earth analog would not be detectable by LUVOIR or HabEx, planets around M-dwarfs close to the Sun would show detectable signals at $3\\,\u03c3$ from city lights, using 300 hours of observing time, for urbanization levels of 0.4% to 3%, while city lights on planets around nearby Sun-like stars would be detectable at urbanization levels of $\\gtrsim10\\%$. The known planet Proxima b is a particularly compelling target for LUVOIR A observations, which would be able to detect city lights twelve times that of Earth in 300 hours, an urbanization level that is expected to occur on Earth around the mid-22nd-century. An ecumenopolis, or planet-wide city, would be detectable around roughly 30 to 50 nearby stars by both LUVOIR and HabEx, and a survey of these systems would place a $1\\,\u03c3$ upper limit of $\\lesssim2\\%$ to $\\lesssim4\\%$, and a $3\\,\u03c3$ upper limit $\\lesssim10\\%$ to $\\lesssim15\\%$, on the frequency of ecumenopolis planets in the Solar neighborhood assuming no detections.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"MNRAS in press.

This is the first detection of D$_2$CS in Space and in dense and cold prestellar regions. Column densities obtained using rotational diagrams and a Large Velocity Gradient model show an extremely high D-enhancement in thioformaldehyde in Barnard 1. Although the column density of H$_2$CS is smaller than that of H$_2$CO, both species show similar D-enhancements in their singly and doubly deuterated species. A chemical model -including multiply deuterated species- has been used in order to interpret the observations. Predicted rotational frequencies from laboratory data for HDCS and D$_2$CS are significantly in error when compared to the observed frequencies in Space. Consequently, we have derived new rotational constants for these two species and for H$_2$CS and H$_2$C$^{34}$S using the observed frequencies in Barnard 1. The new rotational constants allow to predict the rotational transitions of these species with the accuracy needed for the narrow line emerging from dark clouds. Rotational constants for HDCS and D$_2$CS have been obtained from the observed transitions in the laboratory and in Space.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"33 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0410515","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T06:08:06Z","registered":"2022-03-18T06:08:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T06:08:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A precise knowledge of the faces of this convex set is necessary, for example, in the reconstruction of states from their marginals or in the evaluation of complexity measures of many-body systems. Yet, even the two-body marginals of just three qubits were only described in part. Here, we propose an experimental method to search for the coatoms in the lattice of exposed faces of the convex set of quantum marginals. The method is based on sampling from the extreme points of the dual spectrahedron. We provide an algebraic certificate of correctness, employing ground projectors of local Hamiltonians. Using this method, we present an explicit family of coatoms of rank five in the lattice of ground projectors of two-local three-qubit Hamiltonians (the rank is always six for bits). This family describes a family of coatoms in the lattice of exposed faces of the convex set of two-body marginals of three qubits. Besides introducing the experimental method, we show that the support sets of probability distributions that factor are the ground projectors of frustration-free Hamiltonians in the commutative setting. We also discuss nonexposed points of the set of marginals.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"The Version of Record of this article is S. Weis and J.

The lowest order effective theory of the RS model is given by 5-d Einstein gravity which uniquely fixes the self-interactions of gravitons. We demonstrate that large numbers of light KK resonances could be produced at a future lepton-collider-based ``Graviton Factory''. Measuring the self-interactions of these KK gravitons will probe the accuracy of the 5-d Einstein gravity picture and, in addition, yield indirect information on the as yet untested self-coupling of the 4-d graviton. The self-interactions of the gravitons can be studied by measuring the decays of the heavier states to the lighter ones. Using the AdS/CFT picture, these can be interpretted as the decays of heavier resonances to lighter ones, in a strongly coupled 4-d CFT. We show that these decays have sufficient rates to be studied at future colliders and that they are also, in principle, sensitive to higher derivative operators, such as the Gauss-Bonnet term. In a generalized RS model, with non-universal 5-d fermion masses, FCNC's will be induced. We show that precise measurements of the rare decays of KK graviton/gauge states into flavor non-diagonal final states at a Graviton Factory can be used to map the 5-d fermion mass matrix.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Latex, 11 pages, 2 figures.

Constraints on the gravity theory are placed measuring the growth rate of structure within 14 redshift bins between z=0.7 and z=2. The growth rate is measured from redshift-space distortions, i.e. the anisotropy of the clustering pattern induced by coherent peculiar motions. This is performed in the overall context of the Euclid spectroscopic survey, which will simultaneously measure the expansion history of the universe, using the power spectrum and its baryonic features as a standard ruler, accounting for the relative degeneracies of expansion and growth parameters. The resulting expected errors on the growth rate in the different redshift bins, expressed through the quantity f\u03c3_8, range between 1.3% and 4.4%. We discuss the optimisation of the survey configuration and investigate the important dependence on the growth parameterisation and the assumed cosmological model. We show how a specific parameterisation could actually drive the design towards artificially restricted regions of the parameter space. Finally, in the framework of the popular \"\u03b3-parameterisation\", we show that the Euclid spectroscopic survey alone will already be able to provide substantial evidence (in Bayesian terms) if the growth index differs from the GR value \u03b3=0.55 by at least \\sim 0.13. This will combine with the comparable inference power provided by the Euclid weak lensing survey, resulting in Euclid's unique ability to provide a decisive test of modified gravity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 15 figures, accepted by MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6215","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T23:13:11Z","registered":"2022-03-12T23:13:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T23:13:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We aim to answer some fundamental questions about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of phononic operators. These include questions about the potential real and complex nature of the eigenvalues, whether the eigenvectors form a complete basis, what are the right orthogonality relationships, and how to create a complete basis when none may exist at the outset. In doing so we present a unified understanding of the properties of the phononic eigenvalues and eigenvectors which would emerge from any numerical method employed to compute such quantities. We show that the phononic problem can be cast into linear eigenvalue forms from which such quantities as frequencies, wavenumbers, and desired components of wavevectors can be directly ascertained without resorting to searches or quadratic eigenvalue problems and that the relevant properties of such quantities can be determined apriori through the analysis of the associated operators. We further show how the Plane Wave Expansion (PWE) method may be extended to solve each of these eigenvalue forms, thus extending the applicability of the PWE method to cases beyond those which have been considered till now. The theoretical discussions are supplemented with supporting numerical calculations. The techniques and results presented here directly apply to wave propagation in other periodic systems such as photonics.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07144","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T12:03:36Z","registered":"2022-03-01T12:03:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T12:03:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The broad absorption feature at 3.47 $\u03bc$m was detected toward all objects and its optical depth is correlated with the optical depth of H_2O ice, strengthening an earlier finding. The broad absorption feature at 3.25 $\u03bc$m was detected toward two more sources and an upper limit is given for a third source. The optical depths of the 3.25 $\u03bc$m feature obtained to date are better correlated with the optical depth of the refractory silicate dust than with that of H_2O ice. If this trend is confirmed, this would support our proposed identification of the feature as the C--H stretch of aromatic hydrocarbons at low temperature. An absorption feature at 3.53 $\u03bc$m due to solid methanol was detected for the first time toward MonR2/IRS2, as well as toward W33A and GL 2136. The wavelengths of the CH_3OH features toward W33A, GL 2136, and NGC7538/IRS9 can be fit by CH_3OH-rich ices, while the wavelength of the feature toward MonR2/IRS2 suggests an H_2O-rich ice environment. Solid methanol abundances toward GL 2136, NGC7538/IRS9, and MonR2/IRS2 are 3-5 % relative to H_2O ice. There is an additional narrow absorption feature near 3.47 $\u03bc$m toward W33A. For the object W51/IRS2, spatially resolved spectra from 2 to 4 $\u03bc$m indicate that the H_2O ice is located predominantly in front of the eastern component and that the H_2O ice extinction is much deeper than previously estimated. For the object RNO 91, spectra from 2 to 4 $\u03bc$m reveal stellar (or circumstellar) CO gas absorption and deeper H_2O ice extinction than previously estimated.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"33 pages, 19 Postscript figures comprising Figures 1-11 in the text, to be published in Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9903487","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T19:32:42Z","registered":"2022-03-20T19:32:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T19:32:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Jc at 4.2 K for MgB2 tapes made from the 10 um Mg and high purity boron powders was at least a factor of ten higher than values measured for MgB2 samples made from all other starting powders. At 20 K, 5 T, the typical Jc values of the tapes were over 1.0x10^4 A/cm^2 and were much better than those of tape samples reported recently.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 6 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1407","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T01:50:48Z","registered":"2022-03-21T01:50:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T01:50:49Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The basic framework of such algorithm is the auto-encoder like end-to-end architecture with an encoder, a noise layer and a decoder. The key to guarantee robustness is the adversarial training with the differential noise layer. However, we found that none of the existing framework can well ensure the robustness against JPEG compression, which is non-differential but is an essential and important image processing operation. To address such limitations, we proposed a novel end-to-end training architecture, which utilizes Mini-Batch of Real and Simulated JPEG compression (MBRS) to enhance the JPEG robustness. Precisely, for different mini-batches, we randomly choose one of real JPEG, simulated JPEG and noise-free layer as the noise layer. Besides, we suggest to utilize the Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks which can learn better feature in embedding and extracting stage, and propose a \"message processor\" to expand the message in a more appreciate way. Meanwhile, to improve the robustness against crop attack, we propose an additive diffusion block into the network. The extensive experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Under the JPEG compression with quality factor Q=50, our models achieve a bit error rate less than 0.01% for extracted messages, with PSNR larger than 36 for the encoded images, which shows the well-enhanced robustness against JPEG attack. Besides, under many other distortions such as Gaussian filter, crop, cropout and dropout, the proposed framework also obtains strong robustness.

Maps of the clouds were constructed from WISE data and directly compared to the maps of dust optical depth from Planck. The mid-infrared emission per unit dust optical depth has a significant trend toward lower values at higher optical depths. The trend can be quantitatively explained by extinction of starlight within the clouds. The relative amounts of PAH and very small grains traced by WISE, compared to large grains tracked by Planck, are consistent with being constant. The temperature of the large grains significantly decreases for clouds with larger dust optical depth; this trend is partially due to dust property variations but is primarily due to extinction of starlight. We updated the prediction for molecular hydrogen column density, taking into account variations in dust properties, and find it can explain the observed dust optical depth per unit gas column density. Thus the low gas-to-dust ratios in the clouds are most likely due to `dark gas' that is molecular hydrogen.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"published (2017; ApJ, 851, 119)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03316","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T19:31:32Z","registered":"2022-03-01T19:31:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T19:31:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Accuracy beyond density functional theory is often needed to describe the intermolecular interactions, while most correlated wavefunction (CW) methods are prohibitively expensive for large molecules. Therefore, it posts a great challenge to develop an extendible ab initio force field for large flexible organic molecules at CW level of accuracy. In this work, we face this challenge by combining the physics-driven nonbonding potential with a data-driven subgraph neural network bonding model (named sGNN). Tests on polyethylene glycol polymer chains show that our strategy is highly accurate and robust for molecules of different sizes. Therefore, we can develop the force field from small molecular fragments (with sizes easily accessible to CW methods) and safely transfer it to large polymers, thus opening a new path to the next-generation organic force fields.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00927","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T02:18:01Z","registered":"2022-02-21T02:18:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T02:18:02Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the strong absorption regime, the high transmission channels redirect the energy flows to circumvent the absorbing regions to minimize loss. The attenuation of high transmission channels by inhomogeneous absorption is lower than that by homogeneous absorption, regardless of the location of the absorbing region. The statistical distribution of transmission eigenvalues in the former becomes broader than that in the latter, due to a longer tail at high transmission. Since the maximum transmission channel is the most efficient in bypassing the absorbing region, the ratio of its transmittance to the average transmittance increases with absorption, eventually exceeds the ratio without absorption.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00821","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T01:45:15Z","registered":"2022-03-08T01:45:17Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T01:45:17Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The absorption images show an initial rapid expansion of molecules away from the ablation target followed by a much slower diffusion to the cell walls. We study how the time constant for diffusion depends on the helium density and temperature, and obtain values for the YbF-He diffusion cross-section at two different temperatures. We measure the translational and rotational temperatures of the molecules as a function of time since formation, obtain the characteristic time constant for the molecules to thermalize with the cell walls, and elucidate the process responsible for limiting this thermalization rate. Finally, we make a detailed study of how the absorption of the probe laser saturates as its intensity increases, showing that the saturation intensity is proportional to the helium density.

When applied to elementary cellular automata, we obtain classification results, which correlate very well with Wolfram's manual classification. Further, we use it to classify 2D cellular automata to show that our technique can easily be applied to more complex models of computation.

Here, we present a novel experimental scheme for estimating this parameter by using repeated indirect quantum nondemolition measurements in the setup called \"photon box\". This interaction-based scheme is able to achieve the phase sensitivity scaling as $1/N$ with a Fock state of $N$ photons. Moreover, we only need to prepare one initial $N$-photon state and it can be used repetitively for $m$ trials of measurements. This new scheme is shown to sustain the quantum advantage for a much longer time than the damping time of Fock state and be more robust than the common strategy with exotic entangled states. To overcome the $2\u03c0/N$ periodic error in the estimation of the true parameter, we can employ a cascaded strategy by adding a real-time feedback interferometric layout.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6586","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T21:07:52Z","registered":"2022-03-10T21:07:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T21:07:53Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

By enabling robots to optimize their local trajectory estimates without synchronization, ASAPP offers resiliency against communication delays and alleviates the need to wait for stragglers in the network. Furthermore, ASAPP can be applied on the rank-restricted relaxations of PGO, a crucial class of non-convex Riemannian optimization problems that underlies recent breakthroughs on globally optimal PGO. Under bounded delay, we establish the global first-order convergence of ASAPP using a sufficiently small stepsize. The derived stepsize depends on the worst-case delay and inherent problem sparsity, and furthermore matches known result for synchronous algorithms when there is no delay. Numerical evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art synchronous approach, and show ASAPP's resilience against a wide range of delays in practice.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"full paper with appendices","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03281","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T04:07:41Z","registered":"2022-02-26T04:07:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-07-03T01:11:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We calculate the current density profiles and study their dependence on the inner and outer radii of the annular. We study evolution of the persistent currents and track their emergence and decay for different limiting cases of such a geometry, starting from a nanodot and ending by a macroscopic circle. Our analytical results for the currents are confirmed by the agreement between the integration of the corresponding current densities and the application of the Byers-Yang formula, when it is applicable. Among other results we find the general expression for the persistent current in a narrow annulus, which in the one channel approximation reproduces the well-known result for quasi-one dimensional mesoscopic metallic ring. Moreover it allows to analyze the multi-channel case of a relatively wide annulus. Our study can be used for more accurate treatment and interpretation of the experimental data with measurements of the persistent currents in different doubly-connected systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 8 figures, accepted version for the publication","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10276","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T16:05:23Z","registered":"2022-02-23T16:05:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T16:05:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, the blurred light spot due to scattering still holds lots of information remaining to be explored. Former methods failed to recover the polarized hyperspectral information from scattered incoherent light or relied on additional dispersion elements. Here we put forward the transmission matrix (TM) approach for extended objects under incoherent illumination by speculating the unknown TM through experimentally calibrated or digitally emulated ways. Employing a fiber bundle as a powerful imaging and dispersion element, we recover the spatial information in 252 polarized-spectral channels from a single speckle, thus achieving single-shot, high-resolution, broadband hyperspectral imaging for two polarization states with the cheap, compact, fiber-bundle-only system. Based on the scattering principle itself, our method not only greatly improves the robustness of the TM approach to retrieve the input spectral information, but also reveals the feasibility to explore the polarized spatio-spectral information from blurry speckles only with the help of simple optical setups.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04538","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-23T23:07:44Z","registered":"2022-02-23T23:07:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-07-29T01:17:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The dHvA frequencies, named alpha and beta, are detected for the field directions between c and a-axes. The frequency of branch beta increases rapidly with the field angle tilted from c to a-axis, while branch alpha splits, owing to the maximal and minimal cross-sectional areas from the same Fermi surface. Both dHvA branches, alpha and beta reveal two kinds of cylindrical Fermi surfaces with a strong corrugation at least for branch alpha. The angular dependence of the dHvA frequencies is in very good agreement with that calculated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method taking into account the on-site Coulomb repulsion of U = 2 eV, indicating the main Fermi surfaces are experimentally detected. The detected cyclotron effective masses are large in the range from 32 to 57 m0 . They are approximately 10-20 times lager than the corresponding band masses, consistent with the mass enhancement obtained from the Sommerfeld coefficient and the calculated density of states at the Fermi level.

Theoretical results giving the effective optical tensor of a short-pitch DHFLC expressed in terms of the smectic tilt angle and the refractive indices of FLC are used to fit the experimental data. Optical anisotropy of the FLC material is found to be weakly biaxial. For both the transmissive and reflective modes, the results of fitting are applied to model phase and amplitude modulation of light in the DHFLC cell. We demonstrate that, if the thickness of the DHFLC layer is about 50 $\u03bc$m, the detrimental effect of field-induced rotation of the in-plane optical axes on the characteristics of an axicon designed using the DHFLC spatial light modulator in the reflective mode is negligible.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 11 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04964","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T21:39:29Z","registered":"2022-03-07T21:39:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T21:39:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, the latter is afflicted by ambiguities. Regge and Teitelboim found a procedure to lift the arbitrariness in the Hamiltonian framework. An alternative covariant formula was proposed by one of us for an arbitrary variation of the superpotential, it depends only on the equations of motion and on the gauge symmetry under consideration. Here we emphasize that in order to compute the charges, it is enough to stay at a boundary of spacetime, without requiring any hypothesis about the bulk or about other boundary components, so one may speak of holographic charges. It is well known that the asymptotic symmetries that lead to conserved charges are really defined at infinity, but the choice of boundary conditions and surface terms in the action and in the charges is usually determined through integration by parts whereas each component of the boundary should be considered separately. We treat the example of gravity (for any space-time dimension, with or without cosmological constant), formulated as an Affine theory which is a natural generalization of the Palatini and Cartan-Weyl (vielbein) first order formulations. We then show that the superpotential associated to a Dirichlet boundary condition on the metric (the one needed to treat asymptotically flat or AdS spacetimes) is the one proposed by Katz, Biuc{\u00e1}k and Lynden-Bell and not that of Komar. We finally discuss the KBL superpotential at null infinity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, minor corrections and references added.

Four phases or shapes of the steady-state probability of a fraction of agents in a given state are found (unimodal, bimodal, W and M). In the unimodal (resp. bimodal) phase, the copying (resp. intrinsic) mechanism is globally dominant, while in the W (resp. M) phase the copying (resp. intrinsic) mechanism is the relevant one close to the consensus states while it reduces its influence as approaching coexistence. In the thermodynamic limit, the bimodal and W phases disappear, while the unimodal and M phases prevail.

As long as the planet orbits inside the Alfv\u00e9n surface of the stellar wind, the magnetic interaction between the star and the planet can modify the wind properties and also lead to direct angular momentum transfers between the two. We model these star-planet interactions using compressible magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, and quantify the angular momentum transfers between the star, the planet, and the stellar wind. We study the cases of magnetized and non-magnetized planets and vary the orbital radius inside the Alfv\u00e9n surface of the stellar wind. Based on a grid of numerical simulations, we propose general scaling laws for the modification of the stellar wind torque, for the torque between the star and the planet, and for the planet migration associated with the star-planet magnetic interactions. We show that when the coronal magnetic field is large enough and the star is rotating sufficiently slowly, the effect of the magnetic star-planet interaction is comparable to tidal effects and can lead to a rapid orbital decay.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5268","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T17:42:11Z","registered":"2022-03-09T17:42:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T17:42:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Finally we demonstrate that the $M_{\\rm baryon}$-$\u03c3$ distribution of our SMGs is consistent with that followed by early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster, providing strong support to the suggestion that SMGs are progenitors of massive local spheroidal galaxies.

Experiments are carried out using nonuniform evaporation of an isopropanol film containing polystyrene microspheres in a cylindrical cell. The local inhomogeneity of the vapor flux density is achieved by exploiting the temperature gradient. A copper rod is mounted in the central part of the bottom of the cell for further heating. The thermocapillary flow resulting from the surface tension gradient, due in turn to the temperature drop, transfers the particles that were originally at rest at the bottom of the cell. The effect of the initial thickness of the liquid layer on the height and base area of the cluster formed in the central region of the cell is studied. The velocity is measured using particle image velocimetry. A model describing the initial stage of the process is developed. The equations of heat transfer and thermal conductivity are used to define the temperature distribution in the liquid and in the cell. The fluid flow is simulated using the lubrication approximation. The particle distribution is modeled using the convection-diffusion equation. The evaporation flux density is calculated using the Hertz-Knudsen equation. The dependence of the liquid viscosity on the particle concentration is described by Mooney's formula. Numerical results show that the liquid film gradually becomes thinner in the central region, as the surface tension decreases with the increasing temperature. The liquid flow is directed to the heater near the substrate, and it transfers the particles to the center of the cell. The volume fraction of the particles increases over time in this region. The heat flow from the heater affects the geometry of the cluster for two reasons: first, the Marangoni flow velocity depends on the temperature gradient, and second, the decrease ...","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05511","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-22T08:59:00Z","registered":"2022-02-22T08:59:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-22T08:59:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A key difficulty of such approach lies in making accurate predictions about the decisions of other agents. In this paper, we present a trainable online decentralized planning algorithm based on decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search, combined with models of teammates learned from previous episodic runs. By only allowing one agent to adapt its models at a time, under the assumption of ideal policy approximation, successive iterations of our method are guaranteed to improve joint policies, and eventually lead to convergence to a Nash equilibrium. We test the efficiency of the algorithm by performing experiments in several scenarios of the spatial task allocation environment introduced in [Claes et al., 2015]. We show that deep learning and convolutional neural networks can be employed to produce accurate policy approximators which exploit the spatial features of the problem, and that the proposed algorithm improves over the baseline planning performance for particularly challenging domain configurations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Sole copyright holder is IJCAI, all rights reserved.

Many multi-agent problems include constraints that produce different gains (or costs) for the participating agents. Asymmetric gains of constrained agents cannot be naturally represented by the standard DCOP model. The present paper proposes a general framework for Asymmetric DCOPs (ADCOPs). In ADCOPs different agents may have different valuations for constraints that they are involved in. The new framework bridges the gap between multi-agent problems which tend to have asymmetric structure and the standard symmetric DCOP model. The benefits of the proposed model over previous attempts to generalize the DCOP model are discussed and evaluated. Innovative algorithms that apply to the special properties of the proposed ADCOP model are presented in detail. These include complete algorithms that have a substantial advantage in terms of runtime and network load over existing algorithms (for standard DCOPs) which use alternative representations. Moreover, standard incomplete algorithms (i.e., local search algorithms) are inapplicable to the existing DCOP representations of asymmetric constraints and when they are applied to the new ADCOP framework they often fail to converge to a local optimum and yield poor results.

Here we report the observation of a correlated interlayer exciton insulator in a double-layer heterostructure composed of a WSe2 monolayer and a WS2/WSe2 moir\u00e9 bilayer that are separated by an ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The moir\u00e9 WS2/WSe2 bilayer features a Mott insulator state at hole density p/p0 = 1, where p0 corresponds to one hole per moir\u00e9 lattice site. When electrons are added to the Mott insulator in the WS2/WSe2 moir\u00e9 bilayer and an equal number of holes are injected into the WSe2 monolayer, a new interlayer exciton insulator emerges with the holes in the WSe2 monolayer and the electrons in the doped Mott insulator bound together through interlayer Coulomb interactions. The excitonic insulator is stable up to a critical hole density of ~ 0.5p0 in the WSe2 monolayer, beyond which the system becomes metallic. Our study highlights the opportunities for realizing novel quantum phases in double-layer moir\u00e9 systems due to the interplay between the moir\u00e9 flat band and strong interlayer electron interactions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07131","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T01:13:25Z","registered":"2022-02-21T01:13:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-08-10T01:08:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Thus the dynamics of dwarf galaxies in a cluster can provide valuable insights into its dynamical history. With this in mind, we look for differences between the spatial and velocity distributions of giant (b&lt;18) and dwarf (b&gt;18) galaxies in the Coma cluster. Our redshift sample contains new measurements from the 2dF and WYFFOS spectrographs, making it more complete at faint magnitudes than any previously studied sample of Coma galaxies. It includes 745 cluster members - 452 giants and 293 dwarfs. We find that the line-of-sight velocity distribution of the giants is significantly non-Gaussian, but not that for the dwarfs. A battery of statistical tests of both the spatial and localised velocity distributions of the galaxies in our sample finds no strong evidence for differences between the giant and dwarf populations. These results rule out the cluster as a whole having moved significantly towards equipartition, and they are consistent with the cluster having formed via mergers between dynamically-relaxed subclusters.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages, 6 figures, to appear in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0111038","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T10:20:30Z","registered":"2022-03-19T10:20:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T10:20:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Natural inflation is a limiting case of this model, is also studied here. The specific form of the EGB coupling gives ample opportunity to study the rich phenomenology associated with inflation as well as the reheating epoch. Predicted values of the inflationary observables, tensor to scalar ratio ($r$), and spectral index ($n_s$) are in good agreement with the recent observations from $Planck'18$ \\cite{Planck2018}. Thus, in the framework of EGB one can resurrect the model, which otherwise needs quite a bit of fine tuning or diversion from the canonical domain as studied in \\cite{Bhattacharya:2018xlw}, to survive in the standard cold inflationary scenario.

We compare the results with the predictions of the recently proposed sound shell model. For the gravitational wave power spectrum, we find that the predicted $k^{-3}$ behaviour, where $k$ is the wavenumber, emerges clearly for detonations. The power spectra from deflagrations show similar features, but exhibit a steeper high-$k$ decay and an extra feature not accounted for in the model. There are two independent length scales: the mean bubble separation and the thickness of the sound shell around the expanding bubble of the low temperature phase. It is the sound shell thickness which sets the position of the peak of the power spectrum. The low wavenumber behaviour of the velocity power spectrum is consistent with a causal $k^{3}$, except for the thinnest sound shell, where it is steeper. We present parameters for a simple broken power law fit to the gravitational wave power spectrum for wall speeds well away from the speed of sound where this form can be usefully applied. We examine the prospects for the detection, showing that a LISA-like mission has the sensitivity to detect a gravitational wave signal from sound waves with an RMS fluid velocity of about $0.05c$, produced from bubbles with a mean separation of about $10^{-2}$ of the Hubble radius. The shape of the gravitational wave power spectrum depends on the bubble wall speed, and it may be possible to estimate the wall speed, and constrain other phase transition parameters, with an accurate measurement of a stochastic gravitational wave background.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16+1 pages, 9+1 figures; v2: added a few paragraphs about the importance of turbulence, published in PRD; v3: added erratum correcting two equations and the SNR plot, methods and conclusions unchanged","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05871","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T02:11:37Z","registered":"2022-03-05T02:11:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T02:11:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our composites are generated in bins of FWHM Hbeta and FeII strength as defined in our 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) formalism. We find no evidence for a systematic FeII redshift and consistency with previous assumptions that FeII shift and width (FWHM) follow Hbeta shift and FWHM in virtually all sources. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that FeII emission (quasi-ubiquitous in type 1 sources) arises from a broad-line region with geometry and kinematics the same as that producing the Balmer lines.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 1 table, 1 figure - accepted for publication in ApJ Letters","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5992","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T23:11:12Z","registered":"2022-03-12T23:11:13Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T23:11:13Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Multiple, strongly variable short-lived H2O emission features were detected in a broad interval of radial velocities, from -7 to 55 km/s.

The extended spectrum and fast variability of the H2O maser emission together with the variability of the Zeeman splitting components in the main OH lines can be due to the composite clumpy structure of the molecular cloud and to the presence in it of large-scale rotation and bipolar outflow as well as of turbulent motions of material.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 2 tables, 8 figures, accepted by Astronomicheskii Zhurnal (Astronomy Reports)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0683","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T17:31:22Z","registered":"2022-03-11T17:31:24Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T17:31:24Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In addition, a connection is observed between the diode turn-on and the onset of imprinted nuclear polarization, while traditional dynamic nuclear polarization exhibits relatively little voltage dependence.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to Physical Review B Rapid Communications. 15 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0304030","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T14:18:41Z","registered":"2022-03-18T14:18:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T14:18:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The multilingual versions of such pretrained representations provide a possibility of jointly learning many languages with the same model. Although it is expected to gain big with such joint training, in the case of cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR), the models under a multilingual setting are not achieving the same level of performance as those under a monolingual setting. We hypothesize that the performance drop is due to the translation gap between query and documents. In the monolingual retrieval task, because of the same lexical inputs, it is easier for model to identify the query terms that occurred in documents. However, in the multilingual pretrained models that the words in different languages are projected into the same hyperspace, the model tends to translate query terms into related terms, i.e., terms that appear in a similar context, in addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. This property is creating difficulties for the model to connect terms that cooccur in both query and document. To address this issue, we propose a novel Mixed Attention Transformer (MAT) that incorporates external word level knowledge, such as a dictionary or translation table. We design a sandwich like architecture to embed MAT into the recent transformer based deep neural models. By encoding the translation knowledge into an attention matrix, the model with MAT is able to focus on the mutually translated words in the input sequence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the external knowledge and the significant improvement of MAT embedded neural reranking model on CLIR task.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02789","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T01:07:48Z","registered":"2022-02-21T01:07:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T01:07:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our data contains simultaneous photometric correction which confirms the flaring behaviour observed in previous optical and UV data. In this system all lines show a triple peaked structure where the outer two peaks are associated with the accretion disc around the compact object. The main aim of this paper is to constrain the origin of the central peak, also called ``central spike''. We find that the central spike contributes to the flare spectra indicating that its origin is probably the compact object. We also detect that the central spike moves with orbital phase following an S-wave pattern. The radial velocity semiamplitude of the S-wave is ~10 km/s indicating that its origin is near the centre of mass of the system, which in this case lies very close to the white dwarf. Our resolution is higher than that of previous data which allows us to resolve structure in the central peak of the line. The central spike in three of the HeI lines shows another peak blueshifted with respect to the main peak. We propose that one of the peaks is a neutral helium forbidden transition excited in a high electron density region. This forbidden transition is associated with the permitted one (the stronger peak in two of the lines). The presence of a high electron density region again favours the white dwarf as their origin.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 16 figures.

The most promising signatures for IMBHs are found in the cores of GCs, where the evidence now comes from the stellar velocity distribution, the surface density profile, and, for very deep observations, the mass-segregation profile near the cluster center. However, interpretation of the data, and, in particular, constraints on central IMBH masses, require the use of detailed cluster dynamical models. Here we present results from Monte Carlo cluster simulations of GCs that harbor IMBHs. As an example of application, we compare velocity dispersion, surface brightness and mass-segregation profiles with observations of the GC M10, and constrain the mass of a possible central IMBH in this cluster. We find that, although M10 does not seem to possess a cuspy surface density profile, the presence of an IMBH with a mass up to 0.75% of the total cluster mass, corresponding to about 600 Msun, cannot be excluded. This is also in agreement with the surface brightness profile, although we find it to be less constraining, as it is dominated by the light of giants, causing it to fluctuate significantly. We also find that the mass-segregation profile cannot be used to discriminate between models with and without IMBH. The reason is that M10 is not yet dynamically evolved enough for the quenching of mass segregation to take effect. Finally, detecting a velocity dispersion cusp in clusters with central densities as low as in M10 is extremely challenging, and has to rely on only 20-40 bright stars. It is only when stars with masses down to 0.3 Msun are included that the velocity cusp is sampled close enough to the IMBH for a significant increase above the core velocity dispersion to become detectable.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2497","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T18:58:31Z","registered":"2022-03-11T18:58:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T18:58:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We also propose physics applications of the new equations, and we introduce a spin generalization of the standard intermediate long-wave equation which interpolates between the matrix Korteweg-de Vries equation, the Heisenberg ferromagnet equation, and the spin BO equation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"34 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07269","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-01-20T02:01:06Z","registered":"2022-01-20T02:01:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-06-07T01:58:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

While there are many studies on the phenomenology of single particles, correlation dynamics in multipartite systems is largely unexplored. Here, we show that the Schr\u00f6dinger--Newton interactions preserve the product form of the initial state of a many-body system, yet on average agreeing with classical mechanics of continuous mass distributions. This leads to a simple test of the model, based on verifying bipartite gravitational evolution towards non-product states. We show using standard quantum mechanics that, with currently accessible single-particle parameters, two masses released from harmonic traps get correlated well before any observable entanglement is accumulated. Therefore, the Schr\u00f6dinger--Newton model can be tested with setups aimed at observation of gravitational entanglement with significantly relaxed requirements on coherence time. We also present a mixed-state extension of the model that avoids superluminal signaling.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"to appear in \"Classical and Quantum Gravity\"","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09230","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-06-14T01:59:47Z","registered":"2024-06-14T01:59:48Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-11-21T03:12:39Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The nuclear modification factor is obtained by dividing the jet spectrum measured in Pb-Pb by that in pp collisions scaled by the number of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions estimated using a Glauber model. $R_{\\rm AA}$ is found to be $0.28\\pm0.04$ in 0-10% and $0.35\\pm0.04$ in 10-30% collisions, independent of $p_{\\rm T,jet}$ within the uncertainties of the measurement.

Aims: To perform a detailed abundance study of the Herbig Ae star HD 101412, taking advantage of its unusually sharp spectral lines. Methods: High-resolution spectra are measured for accurate wavelengths and equivalent widths. Balmer-line fits and ionization equlibria give a relation between Teff, and log(g). Abundance anomalies and uncertain reddening preclude the use of spectral type or photometry to fix Teff. Excitation temperatures are used to break the degeneracy between Teff and log(g). Results: Strong lines are subject to an anomalous saturation that cannot be removed by assuming a low microturbulence. By restricting the analysis to weak (&lt;= 20 m[A]) lines, we find consistent results for neutral and ionized species, based on a model with Teff = 8300K, and log(g)=3.8. The photosphere is depleted in the most refractory elements, while volatiles are normal or, in the case of nitrogen, overabundant with respect to the sun. The anomalies are unlike those of Ap or Am stars. Conclusions: We suggest the anomalous saturation of strong lines arises from heating of the upper atmospheric layers by infalling material from a disk. The overall abundance pattern may be related to those found for the Lambda Boo stars, though the depletions of the refractory elements are milder, more like those of Vega. However, the intermediate volatile zinc is depleted, precluding a straightforward interpretation of the abundance pattern in terms of gas-grain separation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics; 7 pages, 7 figs., 2 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1601","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T00:00:28Z","registered":"2022-03-14T00:00:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T00:00:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

After ~4.5 years since its discovery, the source had a transition to the hard intermediate state. We performed spectral and timing studies of the transition showing that, unlike the majority of the transient black holes, the system did not go to the soft states but it returned to the hard state after a few months. During this transition Swift J1753.5-0127 features properties which are similar to those displayed by the black hole Cygnus X-1. We compared Swift J1753.5-0127 to one dynamically confirmed black hole and two neutron stars showing that its power spectra are in agreement with the binary hosting a black hole. We also suggest that the prolonged period at low flux that followed the initial flare is reminiscent of that observed in other X-ray binaries, as well as in cataclysmic variables.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3537","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T19:06:57Z","registered":"2022-03-11T19:06:58Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T19:06:58Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"This is the author's version of the accepted paper (not the IEEE-published version).

(2008) have reported a large-scale early-time instability in coupled dark energy and dark matter models. We take the same form of energy-momentum exchange and specialise to the case when the interaction rate is proportional to Hubble's parameter and the dark energy density only. Provided the coupling is made small enough for a given equation of state parameter, we show that the instability can be avoided. Expressions are derived for non-adiabatic modes on super-horizon scales in both the radiation and matter dominated regimes. We also examine the growth of dark matter perturbations in the sub-horizon limit. There we find that the coupling has almost no effect upon the growth of structure before dark energy begins to dominate. Once the universe begins to accelerate, the relative dark matter density fluctuations not only cease to grow as in uncoupled models, but actually decay as the universe continues to expand.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Updated to match version published in February edition of Phys.Rev.D","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3272","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T17:56:05Z","registered":"2022-03-15T17:56:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T17:56:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To this end, we explore road network extraction at scale with inference of semantic features of the graph, identifying speed limits and route travel times for each roadway. We call this approach City-Scale Road Extraction from Satellite Imagery v2 (CRESIv2), Including estimates for travel time permits true optimal routing (rather than just the shortest geographic distance), which is not possible with existing remote sensing imagery based methods. We evaluate our method using two sources of labels (OpenStreetMap, and those from the SpaceNet dataset), and find that models both trained and tested on SpaceNet labels outperform OpenStreetMap labels by greater than 60%. We quantify the performance of our algorithm with the Average Path Length Similarity (APLS) and map topology (TOPO) graph-theoretic metrics over a diverse test area covering four cities in the SpaceNet dataset. For a traditional edge weight of geometric distance, we find an aggregate of 5% improvement over existing methods for SpaceNet data. We also test our algorithm on Google satellite imagery with OpenStreetMap labels, and find a 23% improvement over previous work. Metric scores decrease by only 4% on large graphs when using travel time rather than geometric distance for edge weights, indicating that optimizing routing for travel time is feasible with this approach.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"In Proceedings WACV 2020. 8 pages, 11 figures, 5 appendices. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1904.09901","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09715","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T09:40:24Z","registered":"2022-02-27T09:40:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T09:40:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

When just few training data are available, it is beneficial to have a compact parametrization in order to ameliorate the ill-posedness of the neural network training problem. By linearly restricting high-dimensional maps to informed reduced bases of the inputs, one can compress high-dimensional maps in a constructive way that can be used to detect appropriate basis ranks, equipped with rigorous error estimates. A scalable neural network learning framework is thus to learn the nonlinear compressed reduced basis mapping. Unlike the reduced basis construction, however, neural network constructions are not guaranteed to reduce errors by adding representation power, making it difficult to achieve good practical performance. Inspired by recent approximation theory that connects ResNets to sequential minimizing flows, we present an adaptive ResNet construction algorithm. This algorithm allows for depth-wise enrichment of the neural network approximation, in a manner that can achieve good practical performance by first training a shallow network and then adapting. We prove universal approximation of the associated neural network class for $L^2_\u03bd$ functions on compact sets. Our overall framework allows for constructive means to detect appropriate breadth and depth, and related compact parametrizations of neural networks, significantly reducing the need for architectural hyperparameter tuning. Numerical experiments for parametric PDE problems and a 3D CFD wing design optimization parametric map demonstrate that the proposed methodology can achieve remarkably high accuracy for limited training data, and outperformed other neural network strategies we compared against.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07096","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-19T06:58:00Z","registered":"2022-02-19T06:58:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-12-08T02:03:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Some are focusing on the analysis of one or another novel formulation of \"empty spacetime\", postponing to later stages the introduction of particles and fields, while other approaches assume that spacetime should only be an emergent entity. We here argue that recent progress in the covariant formulation of quantum mechanics suggests that empty spacetime is not physically meaningful. We illustrate our general thesis in the specific context of the noncommutative Snyder spacetime, which is also of some intrinsic interest, since hundreds of studies were devoted to its analysis. We show that empty Snyder spacetime, described in terms of a suitable kinematical Hilbert space, is discrete, but this is only a formal artifact: the discreteness leaves no trace on the observable properties of particles on the physical Hilbert space.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4773","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T05:35:33Z","registered":"2022-03-10T05:35:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T05:35:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the present work, we extend the comparison by considering the Krieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI) approximation, which is a beyond-semilocal approximation.

Far-IR and mm observations have revealed their dust, neutral and molecular gas properties. The sensitivity of JWST at rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths now allows the study of the stellar and ionized gas content. We investigate the spatially resolved distribution and kinematics of the ionized gas in GN20, a dusty star forming galaxy at $z$=4.0548. We present deep MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy of the near-infrared rest-frame emission of GN20. We detect spatially resolved \\paa, out to a radius of 6 kpc, distributed in a clumpy morphology. The star formation rate derived from \\paa\\ (144 $\\pm$ 9 \\msunperyear) is only 7.7 $\\pm 0.5 $\\% of the infrared star formation rate (1860 $\\pm$ 90 \\msunperyear). We attribute this to very high extinction (A$_V$ = 17.2 $\\pm$ 0.4 mag, or A$_{V,mixed}$ = 44 $\\pm$ 3 mag), especially in the nucleus of GN20, where only faint \\paa\\ is detected, suggesting a deeply buried starburst. We identify four, spatially unresolved, clumps in the \\paa\\ emission. Based on the double peaked \\paa\\ profile we find that each clump consist of at least two sub-clumps. We find mass upper limits consistent with them being formed in a gravitationally unstable gaseous disk. The UV bright region of GN20 does not have any detected \\paa\\ emission, suggesting an age of more than 10 Myrs for this region of the galaxy. From the rotation profile of \\paa\\ we conclude that the gas kinematics are rotationally dominated and the $v_{rot}/\u03c3_{m} = 3.8 \\pm 1.4$ is similar to low-redshift LIRGs.

Measurements are conducted using the PoGOLite Pathfinder - a balloon-borne polarimeter. Polarisation is determined by measuring the azimuthal Compton scattering angle of incident X-rays in an array of plastic scintillators housed in an anticoincidence well. The polarimetric response has been characterised prior to flight using both polarised and unpolarised calibration sources. We address possible systematic effects through observations of a background field.

I will discuss an interesting possibility that dust is responsible for this phenomenon. The dust is known to be present in quasars in the form of a dusty/molecular torus which results in complexity of the appearance of active galaxies. However, this dust is located further from the black hole than the Broad Line Region. We propose that the dust is present also closer in and it is actually responsible for formation of the broad emission lines. The argument is based on determination of the temperature of the disk atmosphere underlying the Broad Line Region: it is close to 1000 K, independently from the black hole mass and accretion rate of the object. The mechanism is simple and universal but leads to a considerable complexity of the active nucleus surrounding. The understanding the formation of BLR opens a way to use it reliably - in combination with reverberation measurement of its size - as standard candles in cosmology.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Expanded version of the text to appear in Proceedings of IAUS 290 \"Feeding Compact Objects: Accretion on All Scales\", C.

In such regime the system relaxes towards a convection-diffusion equation. The first objective of the paper is to show that traditional partitioned IMEX R-K schemes will relax to an explicit scheme for the limit equation with no need of modification of the original system. Of course the explicit scheme obtained in the limit suffers from the classical parabolic stability restriction on the time step. The main goal of the paper is to present an approach, based on IMEX R-K schemes, that in the diffusion limit relaxes to an IMEX R-K scheme for the convection-diffusion equation, in which the diffusion is treated implicitly. This is achieved by an original reformulation of the problem, and subsequent application of IMEX R-K schemes to it. An analysis on such schemes to the reformulated problem shows that the schemes reduce to IMEX R-K schemes for the limit equation, under the same conditions derived for hyperbolic relaxation. Several numerical examples including neutron transport equations confirm the theoretical analysis.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4375","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T02:09:02Z","registered":"2022-03-13T02:09:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T02:09:03Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Because the metallicity and star formation history of Reticulum II appear consistent with all known UFDs, the high r-process abundance of Reticulum II suggests enrichment through a single, rare event, such as a double neutron star (NS) merger. However, we note that this scenario is extremely unlikely, as binary stellar evolution models require significant supernova natal kicks to produce NS-NS or NS-black hole mergers, and these kicks would efficiently remove compact binary systems from the weak gravitational potentials of UFDs. We examine alternative mechanisms for the production of r-process elements in UFDs, including a novel mechanism wherein NSs in regions of high dark matter density implode after accumulating a black-hole-forming mass of dark matter. We find that r-process proto-material ejection by tidal forces, when a single neutron star implodes into a black hole, can occur at a rate matching the r-process abundance of both Reticulum II and the Milky Way. Remarkably, dark matter models which collapse a single neutron star in observed UFDs also solve the missing pulsar problem in the Milky Way Galactic center. We propose tests specific to dark matter r-process production which may uncover, or rule out, this model.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 2 figures, published version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06784","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T16:41:40Z","registered":"2022-03-07T16:41:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T16:41:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Synchrotron and inverse Compton energy losses strongly constrain both the age and the distance of the potential sources of TeV and multi-TeV electrons to $\\rm\\approx 10^5~yr$ and $\\rm \\approx 100-500~pc$, depending on both the absolute value and energy dependence of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient. This suggests that only a few, or just one nearby discrete source may explain the observed spectrum of high energy electrons. On the other hand the measured positron fraction, after initially increasing with particle energy, saturates at a level well below 0.5 and likely drops above $\\sim 400-500$ GeV. This means that the local source(s) of TeV electrons should not produce positrons in equal amount, ruling out scenarios involving pulsars/pulsar winds as the main sources of high energy leptons. In this paper we show that a single, local, and fading source can naturally account for the entire spectrum of cosmic ray electrons in the TeV domain. Even though the nature of such source remains unclear, we discuss known cosmic ray accelerators, such as supernova remnant and stellar wind shocks, which are believed to accelerate preferentially electrons rather than positrons.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07551","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T07:28:02Z","registered":"2022-03-01T07:28:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T07:28:03Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

They exhibit a tunable noise bias yielding an exponential suppression of bit flips with the average photon number and a protection against the remaining phase errors can be ensured by a simple repetition code. We here quantify the cost of a repetition code and provide valuable guidance for the choice of a large scale architecture using cat qubits by realizing a performance analysis based on the computation of discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve with Shor's algorithm. By focusing on a 2D grid of cat qubits with neighboring connectivity, we propose to implement 2-qubit gates via lattice surgery and Toffoli gates with off-line fault-tolerant preparation of magic states through projective measurements and subsequent gate teleportations. All-to-all connectivity between logical qubits is ensured by routing qubits. Assuming a ratio between single- and two-photon losses of 1e-5 and a cycle time of 500 ns, we show concretely that such an architecture can compute a 256-bit elliptic curve logarithm in 9 h with 126133 cat qubits and on average 19 photons by cat state. We give the details of the realization of Shor's algorithm so that the proposed performance analysis can be easily reused to guide the choice of architecture for others platforms.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5+37 pages, 41 figures, 5 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06639","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-02-15T01:44:19Z","registered":"2023-02-15T01:44:20Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-08-07T01:10:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Current recruitment systems assume that a pre-defined pool of workers is available. However, this assumption is not always true, especially in cold-start situations, where a new MCS task has just been released. Additionally, studies show that up to 96\\% of the available candidates are usually not willing to perform the assigned tasks. To tackle these issues, recent works use Online Social Networks (OSNs) and Influence Maximization (IM) to advertise about the desired MCS tasks through influencers, aiming to build larger pools. However, these works suffer from several limitations, such as 1) the lack of group-based selection methods when choosing influencers, 2) the lack of a well-defined worker recruitment process following IM, 3) and the non-dynamicity of the recruitment process, where the workers who refuse to perform the task are not substituted. In this paper, an Influence- and Interest-based Worker Recruitment System (IIWRS), using OSNs, is proposed. The proposed system has two main components: 1) an MCS-, group-, and interest-based IM approach, using a Genetic Algorithm, to select a set of influencers from the network to advertise about the MCS tasks, and 2) a dynamic worker recruitment process which considers the social attributes of workers, and is able to substitute those who do not accept to perform the assigned tasks. Empirical studies are performed using real-life datasets, while comparing IIWRS with existing benchmarks.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10940","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2025-01-22T04:46:02Z","registered":"2025-01-22T04:46:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-01-22T04:46:04Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The sample stars range in mass from ~0.06 to ~1.2 Msun; 72 of them show evidence of disks and we measure mass accretion rates Macc between &lt;10^{-11} and few 10^{-9} Msun/yr, using the colors of the diskless stars as photospheric templates. Our results confirm the dependence of Macc on the mass of the central object, which is stronger for low-mass stars and flattens out for masses larger than ~0.3 Msun; the spread of Macc for any value of the stellar mass is ~2 orders of magnitude. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of disk evolution models. Finally, we analyze the relation between Macc and the excess emission in the Spitzer bands, and find that at Macc ~10^{-10} Msun/yr the inner disks change from optically thin to optically thick.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 17 figures, accepted by A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4468","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T07:55:00Z","registered":"2022-03-14T07:55:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T07:55:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the 2DCH, the collective potential and the mass parameters are determined from three-dimensional tilted axis cranking (TAC) calculations. The broken chiral and signature symmetries in the TAC solutions are restored by the 2DCH. The validity of the 2DCH is illustrated with a triaxial rotor ($\u03b3=-30^\\circ$) coupling to one $h_{11/2}$ proton particle and one $h_{11/2}$ neutron hole. By diagonalizing the 2DCH, the angular momenta and energy spectra are obtained. These results agree with the exact solutions of the particle rotor model (PRM) at high rotational frequencies. However, at low frequencies, the energies given by the 2DCH are larger than those by the PRM due to the underestimation of the mass parameters. In addition, with increasing angular momentum, the transitions from the chiral vibration to chiral rotation and further to longitudinal wobbling motion have been presented in the 2DCH.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 12 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06967","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T23:38:44Z","registered":"2022-03-05T23:38:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T23:38:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this context we report masses, radii and surface gravities of ten very-low-mass stars in eclipsing binary systems, with orbital periods of the order of several days. The objects probe the stellar mass-radius relation in the fully convective regime, $M_\\star \\lesssim 0.35$ M$_\\odot$, down to the hydrogen burning mass-limit, $M_{\\mathrm{HB}} \\sim 0.07$ M$_\\odot$. The stars were detected by the WASP survey for transiting extra-solar planets, as low-mass, eclipsing companions orbiting more massive, F- and G-type host stars. We use eclipse observations of the host stars (TRAPPIST, Leonhard Euler, SPECULOOS telescopes), and radial velocities of the host stars (CORALIE spectrograph), to determine physical properties of the low-mass companions. Companion surface gravities are derived from the eclipse and orbital parameters of each system. Spectroscopic measurements of the host star effective temperature and metallicity are used to infer the host star mass and age from stellar evolution models. Masses and radii of the low-mass companions are then derived from the eclipse and orbital parameters of each system. The objects are compared to stellar evolution models for low-mass stars, to test for an effect of the stellar metallicity and orbital period on the radius of low-mass stars in close binary systems. Measurements are in good agreement with stellar models; an inflation of the radii of low-mass stars with respect to model predictions is limited to 1.6 $\\pm$ 1.2% in the fully convective regime. The sample of ten objects indicates a scaling of the radius of low-mass stars with the host star metallicity. No correlation between stellar radii and orbital periods of the binary systems is determined. A combined analysis with comparable objects from the literature is consistent with this result.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10808","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T14:52:55Z","registered":"2022-02-28T14:52:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T14:52:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Baryon masses provide an important example of the 1/N_c expansion, and successful predictions of masses of heavy-quark baryons continue to be tested by experiment. The ground state charmed baryon masses have all been measured, and five of the eight ground state bottom baryon masses have been found.

However, alternative interpretations have been proposed, included broadening due to Compton scattering in a wind or accretion disk atmosphere. Here we explore the observational signatures expected from broadening in a wind, in particular that the iron line width should increase with an increase in the column density of the absorber (due to an increase in the number of scatterings). We study the data from three neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries where both a broad iron emission line and absorption lines are seen simultaneously, and show that there is no significant correlation between line width and column density. This favors an inner disk origin for the line broadening rather than scattering in a wind.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 1 table, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4023","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T16:41:30Z","registered":"2022-03-10T16:41:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T16:41:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The variation of the meander wavelength with the deposition flux and with the activation barriers for step adatom detachment and step crossing (the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier) is studied in detail. The interpretation of recent experiments on surfaces vicinal to Cu(100) [T. Maroutian et al., Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 64}, 165401 (2001)] in the light of our results yields an estimate for the kink barrier at the close packed steps.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 7 .eps figures.

By drawing more attention from the visible region, our model can predict the invisible patch more effectively than the baseline models, especially in instances with uniform texture. The model is trained on COCOA dataset and two subsets of it in a self-supervised manner.

We take advantage of tools from the complex network field to analyze them and determine their properties. We show that WS interaction networks exhibit some of the typical characteristics observed in real-world networks, such as short average distance between nodes and community structure.

The geometrical structure and the evolution pattern of extra dimensions therefore may play an important role in cosmology. Various possible impacts of extra dimensions on cosmology are investigated. In one way, the evolution of homogeneous extra dimensions may contribute to dark energy, driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. In the other way, both the energy perturbations in the ordinary three-space, combined with homogeneous extra dimensions, and the inhomogeneities in the extra space may contribute to dark matter. In this paper we wish to sketch the basic idea and show how extra dimensions may lead to the dark side of our universe.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 3 figures.

Machine learning (ML) models for sound event detection (SED) and speaker identification (SID) can enable headphones to selectively pass through important sounds; however, implementing these models for a user-centric experience presents several unique challenges. First, most people spend limited time customizing their headphones, so the sound detection should work reasonably well out of the box. Second, the models should be able to learn over time the specific sounds that are important to users based on their implicit and explicit interactions. Finally, such models should have a small memory footprint to run on low-power headphones with limited on-chip memory. In this paper, we propose addressing these challenges using HiSSNet (Hierarchical SED and SID Network). HiSSNet is an SEID (SED and SID) model that uses a hierarchical prototypical network to detect both general and specific sounds of interest and characterize both alarm-like and speech sounds. We show that HiSSNet outperforms an SEID model trained using non-hierarchical prototypical networks by 6.9 - 8.6 percent. When compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained specifically for SED or SID alone, HiSSNet achieves similar or better performance while reducing the memory footprint required to support multiple capabilities on-device.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07538","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-03-15T00:54:42Z","registered":"2023-03-15T00:54:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-06-21T16:06:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The transition is shown to be driven by a correlation-induced enhancement of the crystal field splitting within the $t_{2g}$ manifold, which results in a suppression of the hybridization between the $a_{1g}$ and $e_g^\u03c0$ bands. We discuss the changes in the effective quasi-particle band structure caused by the correlations and the corresponding self-energies. At temperatures of about 400 K we find the $a_{1g}$ orbitals to display coherent quasi-particle behavior, while a large imaginary part of the self-energy and broad features in the spectral function indicate that the $e_g^\u03c0$ orbitals are still far above their coherence temperature. The local spectral functions are in excellent agreement with recent bulk sensitive photoemission data. Finally, we also make a prediction for angle-resolved photoemission experiments by calculating momentum-resolved spectral functions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Paper I will appear in condmat in two weeks","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0701263","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T11:30:13Z","registered":"2022-03-16T11:30:14Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T01:03:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We demonstrate how the algorithm works using simple test cases and then apply it to haloes from the Millennium Run simulation (Springel et al. 2005). We show that about 70% of the total halo mass is contained in a structure composed of more than 74,000 individual elements, the vast majority of which are filamentary, with lengths of up to 15 Mpc/h preferred. Spatially more extended structures do exist, as do examples of what appear to be sheet-like configurations of matter. What is more, LSS appears to be composed of a fixed set of basic building blocks. The LSS formed by mass selected subsamples of haloes shows a clear correlation between the threshold mass and the mean extent of major branches, with cluster-size haloes forming structures whose branches can extend to almost 200 Mpc/h - the backbone of LSS to which smaller branches consisting of smaller haloes are attached.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society; 13 pages, with 14 figures and 3 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611641","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T00:47:51Z","registered":"2022-03-17T00:47:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T00:47:53Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The homogeneous state of the electron-hole liquid is stable if the distance between the quantum wells l is sufficiently small. However, as the distance l increases and reaches a certain critical value, the plasmon spectrum of the electron-hole liquid becomes unstable.

Most of the existing graph convolutional networks share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function. In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose Automatic Graph Convolutional Networks (AutoGCN) to capture the full spectrum of graph signals and automatically update the bandwidth of graph convolutional filters. While it is based on graph spectral theory, our AutoGCN is also localized in space and has a spatial form. Experimental results show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods which only work as low-pass filters.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04755","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T08:27:31Z","registered":"2022-02-21T08:27:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-06-23T01:20:09Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For a given binaural microphone setup, the binaural response corresponding to the direct-path propagation of a single source is a function of the source direction. In practice, this response is contaminated by noise and reverberations. The direct-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between the direct-path acoustic transfer function of the two channels. We propose a method to estimate the DP-RTF from the noisy and reverberant microphone signals in the short-time Fourier transform domain. First, the convolutive transfer function approximation is adopted to accurately represent the impulse response of the sensors in the STFT domain. Second, the DP-RTF is estimated by using the auto- and cross-power spectral densities at each frequency and over multiple frames. In the presence of stationary noise, an inter-frame spectral subtraction algorithm is proposed, which enables to achieve the estimation of noise-free auto- and cross-power spectral densities. Finally, the estimated DP-RTFs are concatenated across frequencies and used as a feature vector for the localization of speech source. Experiments with both simulated and real data show that the proposed localization method performs well, even under severe adverse acoustic conditions, and outperforms state-of-the-art localization methods under most of the acoustic conditions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03205","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T18:14:36Z","registered":"2022-03-07T18:14:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T18:14:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this work, we investigate several powerful CSST cosmological probes, including cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, photometric and spectroscopic galaxy clustering, and number counts of galaxy clusters, and study the capability of these probes by forecasting the results of joint constraints on the cosmological parameters. By referring to real observational results, we generate mock data and estimate the measured errors based on CSST observational and instrumental designs. To study the systematical effects on the results, we also consider a number of systematics in CSST photometric and spectroscopic surveys, such as the intrinsic alignment, shear calibration uncertainties, photometric redshift uncertainties, galaxy bias, non-linear effects, instrumental effects, etc. The Fisher matrix method is used to derive the constraint results from individual or joint surveys on the cosmological and systematical parameters. We find that the joint constraints by including all these CSST cosmological probes can significantly improve the results from current observations by one order of magnitude at least, which gives $\u03a9_m$ and $\u03c3_8$ $&lt;$1% accuracy, and $w_0$ and $w_a$ $&lt;$5% and 20% accuracies, respectively.

For a systematic scrutiny of this situation, the $\u039b$CDM paradigm must be complemented by (at least two) physical parameters describing, respectively, a threshold frequency and a slope. The supplementary frequency scale sets the lower border of a high-frequency domain where the spectral energy grows with a slope which depends, predominantly, upon the total sound speed of the plasma right after inflation. While the infra-red region of the graviton energy spectrum is nearly scale-invariant, the expected signals for typical frequencies larger than 0.01 nHz are hereby analyzed in a model-independent framework by requiring that the total sound speed of the post-inflationary plasma be smaller than the speed of light. Current (e.g. low-frequency) upper limits on the tensor power spectra (determined from the combined analysis of the three large-scale data sets) are shown to be compatible with a detectable signal in the frequency range of wide-band interferometers. In the present context, the scrutiny of the early evolution of the sound speed of the plasma can then be mapped onto a reliable strategy of parameter extraction including not only the well established cosmological observables but also the forthcoming data from wide band interferometers.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"47 pages, 31 included figures, to appear in Classical and Quantum Gravity","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4317","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T08:33:53Z","registered":"2022-03-16T08:33:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T08:33:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, the phase of this voltage-controlled parametric oscillator was unable to be locked uniquely by microwave VCMA effect. The oscillation phase is locked in one of two possible states, which originates from the fact that the frequency of the microwave voltage is twice that of the magnetization oscillation. In this work, we investigate the phase locking by additional microwave voltage through analytical and numerical studies of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. An analytical study suggests that the additional voltage makes one of two phases more stable than the other by having asymmetric potential for the phase. The simulation results indicate a trigonometric-function-like dependence of the locked rate on the phase of the additional voltage, which qualitatively agrees with the analytical theory and also suggests a possibility to manipulate the phase by the additional voltage.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05570","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-08-13T02:31:17Z","registered":"2024-08-13T02:31:18Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-08-13T02:31:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Tantalum, like niobium, has proven utility as the primary superconducting layer within highly coherent qubits. But, unlike Nb, high temperatures are typically used to stabilize the desirable body-centered-cubic phase, alpha-Ta, during thin film deposition. It has long been known that a thin Nb layer permits the room-temperature nucleation of alpha-Ta, although neither an epitaxial process nor few-photon microwave loss measurements have been reported for Nb-nucleated Ta films prior to this study. We compare resonators patterned from Ta films grown at high temperature (500 \u00b0C) and films nucleated at room temperature, in order to understand the impact of crystalline order on quantum coherence. In both cases, films grew with Al2O3 (001) || Ta (110) indicating that the epitaxial orientation is independent of temperature and is preserved across the Nb/Ta interface. We use conventional low-power spectroscopy to measure two level system (TLS) loss, as well as an electric-field bias technique to measure the effective dipole moments of TLS in the surfaces of resonators. In our measurements, Nb-nucleated Ta resonators had greater loss tangent (1.5 +/- 0.1 x 10^-5) than non-nucleated (5 +/- 1 x 10^-6) in approximate proportion to defect densities as characterized by X-ray diffraction (0.27 \u00b0 vs 0.18 \u00b0 [110] reflection width) and electron microscopy (30 nm vs 70 nm domain size). The dependence of the loss tangent on domain size indicates that the development of more ordered Ta films is likely to lead to improvements in qubit coherence times. Moreover, low-temperature alpha-Ta epitaxy may enable the growth of new, microstate-free heterostructures which would not withstand high temperature processing.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10306","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-01-26T01:40:14Z","registered":"2023-01-26T01:40:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-09-19T02:29:39Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This large reduction in the characteristic emission time is enabled by a rapid capacitive gating of emission from the quantum dot placed in the intrinsic region of a p-i-n-junction biased below the onset of electroluminescence. Here, the rising edge of the applied voltage pulses triggers the emission of single photons from the optically excited quantum dot.

Shielding and collisional transport are found to be two related aspects of the repulsive deflections of electrons, in such a way that each particle is shielded by all other ones while keeping in uninterrupted motion.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1310.3096, arXiv:1210.1546","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4323","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T17:06:13Z","registered":"2022-03-09T17:06:14Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T17:06:14Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It has been shown that the interplay between the hopping dimerization and a staggered quasi-periodic disorder manifests two localization transitions through two intermediate phases resulting in four critical points as a function of the quasiperiodic potential. In this paper, we study the phenomenon of the re-entrant localization transition by examining the spectral properties of the states. By performing a systematic finite-size scaling analysis for a fixed value of the hopping dimerization, we obtain accurate critical disorder strengths for different transitions and the associated critical exponents. Moreover, through a multifractal analysis, we study the critical nature of the states across the localization transitions by computing the mass exponents and the corresponding fractal dimensions of the states. Further, we complement the critical nature of the states by computing the Hausdorff dimensions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 10 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13114","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T11:26:10Z","registered":"2022-02-21T11:26:11Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-06-23T01:23:03Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We find a strong correlation between the observed peak energy Ep and the flux P within individual short GRBs. The slope of the Ep P^s correlation for individual bursts ranges between ~0.4 and ~1. There is no correlation between the low energy spectral index and the peak energy or the flux. Our results show that in our 13 short GRBs Ep evolves in time tracking the flux. This behavior is similar to what found in the population of long GRBs and it is in agreement with the evidence that long GRBs and (the still few) short GRBs with measured redshifts follow the same rest frame Ep-Liso correlation.

In $d=3$, the linear susceptibility remains finite at $\u0393_c$, and while Griffiths singularity effects are certainly observable in the paramagnetic phase, the nonlinear susceptibility appears to diverge only rather close to $\u0393_c$. These results show that Griffiths singularities remain persistent in dimensions above one (where they are known to be strong), though their magnitude decreases monotonically with increasing dimensionality (there being no Griffiths singularities in the limit of infinite dimensionality).","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, REVTEX, 6 eps figures included using the epsf macros; to appear in Phys.

Their fundamental stellar and circumstellar parameters and statistical properties were derived with heterogeneous approaches before Gaia. Our main goal is to contribute to the study of HAeBes from the largest sample of such sources to date, for which stellar and circumstellar properties have been determined homogeneously from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and photometry. Multiwavelength photometry was compiled for 209 bona fide HAeBes for which Gaia EDR3 distances were estimated. Using the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), photospheric models were fit to the optical SEDs to derive stellar parameters, and the excesses at infrared (IR) and longer wavelengths were characterized to derive several circumstellar properties. The stellar temperature, luminosity, radius, mass, and age were derived for each star based on optical photometry. In addition, their IR SEDs were classified according to two different schemes, and their mass accretion rates, disk masses, and the sizes of the inner dust holes were also estimated uniformly. The initial mass function fits the stellar mass distribution of the sample within 2 &lt; M_star/M_sun &lt; 12. In this aspect, the sample is therefore representative of the HAeBe regime and can be used for statistical purposes when it is taken into account that the boundaries are not well probed. A statistical analysis was carried out mainly focused on the different circumstellar properties of Herbig Ae (HAe) and Be (HBe) stars. The complete dataset is available online through a Virtual Observatory-compliant archive, representing the most recent reference for statistical studies on the HAeBe regime.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"45 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables.

COVID-19 is highly contagious and is rapidly spreading, rendering its early diagnosis of preeminent status. Researchers, medical specialists and organizations all over the globe have been working tirelessly to combat this virus and help in its containment. In this paper, a novel neural network called WisdomNet has been proposed, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. The WisdomNet uses the concept of Wisdom of Crowds as its founding idea. It is a two-layered convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes chest x-ray images as input. Both layers of the proposed neural network consist of a number of neural networks each. The dataset used for this study consists of chest x-ray images of COVID-19 positive patients, compiled and shared by Dr. Cohen on GitHub, and the chest x-ray images of healthy lungs and lungs affected by viral and bacterial pneumonia were obtained from Kaggle. The network not only pinpoints the presence of COVID-19, but also gives the probability of the disease maturing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Thus, predicting the progression of the disease in the COVID-19 positive patients. The network also slender the occurrences of false negative cases by employing a high threshold value, thus aids in curbing the spread of the disease and gives an accuracy of 100% for successfully predicting COVID-19 among the chest x-rays of patients affected with COVID-19, bacterial and viral pneumonia.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 4 figures, 1 table","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01392","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T03:03:34Z","registered":"2022-02-21T03:03:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T03:03:35Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The natural development of BCRs must be understood in order to design vaccines for highly mutable pathogens such as influenza and HIV. BCR diversity is induced by naturally occurring combinatorial \"V(D)J\" rearrangement, mutation, and selection processes. Most current methods for BCR sequence analysis focus on separately modeling the above processes. Statistical phylogenetic methods are often used to model the mutational dynamics of BCR sequence data, but these techniques do not consider all the complexities associated with B cell diversification such as the V(D)J rearrangement process. In particular, standard phylogenetic approaches assume the DNA bases of the progenitor (or \"naive\") sequence arise independently and according to the same distribution, ignoring the complexities of V(D)J rearrangement. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to Bayesian phylogenetic inference for BCR sequences that is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). This technique not only integrates a naive rearrangement model with a phylogenetic model for BCR sequence evolution but also naturally accounts for uncertainty in all unobserved variables, including the phylogenetic tree, via posterior distribution sampling.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"26 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11982","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T03:31:23Z","registered":"2022-02-28T03:31:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T03:31:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We propose: (1) using feature maps from well-known pre-trained DNNs to predict rate-quality behavior with limited training data; and (2) improving highest quality rung efficiency by predicting minimum bitrate for top quality and using it for the top rung. The method tested on 102 video scenes demonstrates 94.1% reduction in complexity versus brute-force at 1.71% BD-Rate expense.

At the same time, their mergers could contribute to the recently observed population of gravitational-wave sources. We investigate the scenario in which primordial black holes form binaries at late times in the Universe. Specifically, we re-examine the mergers of primordial black holes in small clusters of ~30 objects in the absence of initial binaries. Binaries form dynamically through Newtonian gravitational interactions. These binaries act as heat sources for the cluster, increasing the cluster's velocity dispersion, which inhibits direct mergers through gravitational-wave two-body captures. Meanwhile, three-body encounters of tight binaries are too rare to tighten binaries sufficiently to allow them to merge through gravitational-wave emission. We conclude that in the absence of initial binaries, merger rates of primordial black holes in the Bird et al. (2016) initial cluster configuration are at least an order of magnitude lower than previously suggested, which makes gravitational-wave detections of such sources improbable.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03483","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T09:31:20Z","registered":"2022-02-27T09:31:21Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T09:31:21Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

While a thermal equilibrium state of the self-gravitating particle system cannot have a finite mass without an artificial wall in the asymptotically flat case, in the asymptotically AdS case, the total mass can be finite without any artificial wall due to the AdS potential barrier. In this case, the typical size of the system is characterized by the AdS radius. The equilibrium states can be parametrized by two independent parameters. Taking the total rest mass as the unit and fixing the AdS radius, we obtain the one-parameter family of equilibria which describes a curve in the parameter space spanned by the gravothermal energy and the temperature. Then we investigate the instability of the system based on the turning point method for each value of the AdS radius. We find that the curve typically has a double spiral structure as in the asymptotically flat case with an artificial wall. The possible value of the gravothermal energy is restricted to the finite region between the first turning points on the two respective spirals.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13714","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T06:23:43Z","registered":"2022-02-23T06:23:44Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T06:23:44Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Stronger bare couplings are usually associated with larger gauge fluctuations, leading to larger cutoff effects and more expensive simulations. In theories with many light fermions, sometimes the desired physical region cannot be reached before encountering a phase boundary. We show that these undesired effects can be reduced by adding Pauli--Villars fields. We reach significantly larger renormalized couplings while at the same time damping short-distance fluctuations of the gauge field.

Therefore the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such stars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically, PPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from massive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim to compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first review the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar number density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far ultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external photoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to an arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric encounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion $\u03c3_v &gt; 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying local environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar density ($n_{c} &gt; 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant role in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a timescale $\\sim 3$ Myr. By combining theoretical mass loss rates due to FUV flux with viscous spreading in a PPD we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely destroyed by external photoevaporation. Comparing these thresholds in local clusters we find that if either mechanism has a significant impact on the PPD population then photoevaporation is always the dominating influence.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages, 17 figures.

Conditions are established for nonnegative directional splittings to hold in a neighborhood of an arbitrary interior point. The result is used to construct monotone finite difference schemes for the boundary value problem of anisotropic diffusion operators. It is shown that such a monotone scheme can be constructed if the underlying diffusion matrix is continuous on the closure of the physical domain and symmetric and uniformly positive definite on the domain, the mesh spacing is sufficiently small, and the size of finite difference stencil is sufficiently large. An upper bound for the stencil size is obtained, which is determined completely by the diffusion matrix. Loosely speaking, the more anisotropic the diffusion matrix is, the larger stencil is required. An exception is the situation with a strictly diagonally dominant diffusion matrix where a three-by-three stencil is sufficient for the construction of a monotone finite difference scheme. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"21 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08177","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T10:18:32Z","registered":"2022-03-08T10:18:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T10:18:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This data set makes SN2013ge one of the best observed normal Type Ib/c SN at early times---when the light curve is particularly sensitive to the progenitor configuration and mixing of radioactive elements---and reveals two distinct light curve components in the UV bands. The first component rises over 4-5 days and is visible for the first week post-explosion. Spectra of the first component have blue continua and show a plethora of high velocity (~15,000 km/s) but narrow (~3500 km/s) features, indicating that the line-forming region is restricted. The explosion parameters estimated for the bulk explosion are standard for Type Ib/c SN, and there is evidence for weak He features at early times. In addition, SN2013ge exploded in a low metallicity environment and we have obtained some of the deepest radio and X-ray limits for a Type Ib/c SN to date, which constrain the progenitor mass-loss rate. We are left with two distinct progenitor scenarios for SN2013ge, depending on our interpretation of the early emission. If the first component is cooling envelope emission, then the progenitor of SN2013ge either possessed a low-mass extended envelope or ejected a portion of its envelope in the final &lt;1 year before core-collapse. Alternatively, if the first component is due to outwardly mixed Ni-56, then our observations are consistent with the asymmetric ejection of a distinct clump of nickel-rich material at high velocities. Current models for the collision of a SN shock with a binary companion cannot reproduce both the timescale and luminosity of the early emission in SN2013ge. Finally, the spectra of the first component of SN2013ge are similar to those of the rapidly-declining SN2002bj.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02694","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T22:40:28Z","registered":"2022-03-07T22:40:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T22:40:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

As reported by other authors, this is the second source which showed transitions between atoll state and `Z' state. We find large scale hysteresis in the almost `C'-like hardness-intensity track of the source in the atoll state. This discovery is likely to provide a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle involving various types of hardness-intensity tracks from `q'-shaped for Aquila X-1, 4U 1608-52, and many black holes to `C'-shaped for many atoll sources. Furthermore, the regular pulsations, a diagonal transition between soft and hard states, and the large scale hysteresis observed from IGR J17480-2446 argue against some of the previous suggestions involving magnetic field about atolls and millisecond pulsars. Our results also suggest that the nature of spectral evolution throughout an outburst does not, at least entirely, depend on the peak luminosity of the outburst. Besides, the source took at least a month to trace the softer banana state, as opposed to a few hours to a day, which is typical for an atoll source. In addition, while the soft colour usually increases with intensity in the softer portion of an atoll source, IGR J17480-2446 showed an opposite behaviour. From the detailed spectral fitting we conclude that a blackbody+powerlaw model is the simplest one, which describes the source continuum spectra well throughout the outburst. We find that these two spectral components were plausibly connected with each other, and they worked together to cause the source state evolution.

The most well-known mathematical model of sleep regulation, the two-process model, models the sleep-wake cycle by two oscillators: a circadian oscillator and a homeostatic oscillator. An alternative, more recent, model considers the mutual inhibition of sleep promoting neurons and the ascending arousal system regulated by homeostatic and circadian processes. Here we show there are fundamental similarities between these two models. The implications are illustrated with two important sleep-wake phenomena. Firstly, we show that in the two-process model, transitions between different numbers of daily sleep episodes occur at grazing bifurcations.This provides the theoretical underpinning for numerical results showing that the sleep patterns of many mammals can be explained by the mutual inhibition model. Secondly, we show that when sleep deprivation disrupts the sleep-wake cycle, ostensibly different measures of sleepiness in the two models are closely related. The demonstration of the mathematical similarities of the two models is valuable because not only does it allow some features of the two-process model to be interpreted physiologically but it also means that knowledge gained from study of the two-process model can be used to inform understanding of the mutual inhibition model. This is important because the mutual inhibition model and its extensions are increasingly being used as a tool to understand a diverse range of sleep-wake phenomena such as the design of optimal shift-patterns, yet the values it uses for parameters associated with the circadian and homeostatic processes are very different from those that have been experimentally measured in the context of the two-process model.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1734","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T20:33:30Z","registered":"2022-03-10T20:33:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T20:33:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Deep in the antiferromagnetic state, the spectra exhibit a \"peak-dip-hump\" line shape associated with two clearly separate branches of dispersion, characteristics of polarons seen in manganites and lightly-doped cuprates. As temperature increases towards the Neel temperature (T_N), we observe a decreasing renormalization of the peak dispersion and a counterintuitive sharpening of the hump linewidth, suggestive of an intimate connection between the weakening electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling and antiferromagnetism. Our finding points to the highly-correlated nature of Fe1.02Te ground state featured by strong interactions among the charge, spin and lattice and a good metallicity plausibly contributed by the coherent polaron motion.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 4 figures.

Paradoxically, observed drifting buoys and floating matter tend to create dissipative-looking patterns near oceanic eddies, which appear to be inconsistent with the conservative fluid particle patterns created by coherent Lagrangian eddies. Here we show that inclusion of inertial effects (i.e., those produced by the buoyancy and size finiteness of an object) in a rotating two-dimensional incompressible flow context resolves this paradox. Specifically, we obtain that anticyclonic coherent Lagrangian eddies attract (repel) negatively (positively) buoyant finite-size particles, while cyclonic coherent Lagrangian eddies attract (repel) positively (negatively) buoyant finite-size particles. We show how these results explain dissipative-looking satellite-tracked surface drifter and subsurface float trajectories, as well as satellite-derived \\emph{Sargassum} distributions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to \\emph{Chaos} Focus Issue on Objective detection of Lagrangian Coherent Structures.

The spectrum of excitations of the flux tube between two null Wilson lines can be viewed as the spectrum of excitations around the infinite spin limit of finite twist operators in the sl(2) sector of N=4 SYM or the Gubser-Klebanov-Polyakov (GKP) string. This regime can be captured exploiting integrability and assuming that wrapping corrections are negligible compared to asymptotic Bethe Ansatz contributions. This assumption holds true for the N=4 SYM background GKP string, but deserves further analysis for excited states. Here, we investigate GKP cousins by considering various classes of (generalized) twist operators in beta-deformed N=4 SYM and ABJM theory. We show that the Y-system of Gromov-Kazakov-Vieira easily leads to accurate large spin expansions of the wrapping correction at lowest order in weak-coupling perturbation theory. As a byproduct, we confirm that wrapping corrections are subleading in all the considered cases.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"37 pages, 6 eps figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2054","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T21:01:25Z","registered":"2022-03-13T21:01:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T21:01:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

If it is true, it might give a counter example to the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, which states that spacetime singularities are never observed by a distant observer. However, so far the proposed process has only been analyzed within a test particle approximation. Here we claim that the back reaction effects of a charged particle cannot be neglected when judging whether the suggested process is really a counter example to the cosmic censorship conjecture or not. Furthermore, we argue that all the back reaction effects can be properly taken into account when we consider the trajectory of a particle on the border between the plunge and bounce orbits. In such marginal cases we find that the Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole can never be overcharged via the absorption of a charged particle. Since all the plunge orbits are expected to have a higher energy than the marginal orbit, we conclude that there is no supporting evidence that indicates the violation of the cosmic censorship in the proposed overcharging process.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, revtex4, minor revision and reference added, version to appear in PRD","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.6207","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T00:17:51Z","registered":"2022-03-13T00:17:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T00:17:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We first write the group-invariant quadratic single-ion and symmetric anisotropic exchange Hamiltonians in the appropriate local coordinates. We then rewrite these local Hamiltonians in the molecular or laboratory representation, along with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriay (DM) and isotropic Heisenberg, biquadratic, and three-center quartic Hamiltonians. Using our exact, compact forms for the single-ion spin matrix elements, we evaluate the eigenstate energies analytically to first order in the microscopic anisotropy interactions, corresponding to the strong exchange limit, and provide tables of simple formulas for the energies of the lowest four eigenstate manifolds of ferromagnetic (FM) and anitiferromagnetic (AFM) tetramers with arbitrary $s_1$. For AFM tetramers, we illustrate the first-order level-crossing inductions for $s_1=1/2,1,3/2$, and obtain a preliminary estimate of the microscopic parameters in a Ni$_4$ from a fit to magnetization data. Accurate analytic expressions for the thermodynamics, electron paramagnetic resonance absorption and inelastic neutron scattering cross-section are given, allowing for a determination of three of the microscopic anisotropy interactions from the second excited state manifold of FM tetramers. We also predict that tetramers with symmetries $S_4$ and $D_{2d}$ should exhibit both DM interactions and multiferroic states, and illustrate our predictions for $s_1=1/2, 1$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 14 figures, submitted to Phys.

If it is not, an intruder can reveal secret messages sent between trusted users. The verification is guaranteed to terminate in cubic time at most on a 2NPDA-simulator. The interpretive approach used in this experiment simplifies the verification, by separating the nondeterministic pushdown logic and program control, and makes it more predictable.

These fluids occur in diverse natural and synthetic forms and can be regarded as the rule rather than the exception. They show very complex strain and time dependent behavior and may have initial yield-stress. Their common feature is that they do not obey the simple Newtonian relation of proportionality between stress and rate of deformation. Non-Newtonian fluids are generally classified into three main categories: time-independent whose strain rate solely depends on the instantaneous stress, time-dependent whose strain rate is a function of both magnitude and duration of the applied stress and viscoelastic which shows partial elastic recovery on removal of the deforming stress and usually demonstrates both time and strain dependency. In this article the key aspects of these fluids are reviewed with particular emphasis on single-phase flow through porous media. The four main approaches for describing the flow in porous media are examined and assessed. These are: continuum models, bundle of tubes models, numerical methods and pore-scale network modeling.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"94 pages, 12 figures, 1 table","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2399","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T16:48:42Z","registered":"2022-03-15T16:48:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T16:48:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Studies have shown that the conventional left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony (LVMD) parameters have their own statistical limitations. The purpose of this study is to extract new LVMD parameters from the phase analysis of gated SPECT MPI by deep learning to help CRT patient selection. Methods. One hundred and three patients who underwent rest gated SPECT MPI were enrolled in this study. CRT response was defined as a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) &gt;= 15% at 6 +- 1 month follow up. Autoencoder (AE), an unsupervised deep learning method, was trained by the raw LV systolic phase polar maps to extract new LVMD parameters, called AE-based LVMD parameters. Correlation analysis was used to explain the relationships between new parameters with conventional LVMD parameters. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to establish a multivariate model for predicting CRT response. Results. Complete data were obtained in 102 patients, 44.1% of them were classified as CRT responders. AE-based LVMD parameter was significant in the univariate (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.44, P = 0.006) and multivariate analyses (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.06, P = 0.006). Moreover, it had incremental value over PSD (AUC 0.72 vs. 0.63, LH 8.06, P = 0.005) and PBW (AUC 0.72 vs. 0.64, LH 7.87, P = 0.005), combined with significant clinic characteristics, including LVEF and gender. Conclusions. The new LVMD parameters extracted by autoencoder from the baseline gated SPECT MPI has the potential to improve the prediction of CRT response.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 3 figures, will submit to journal of nuclear cardiology","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01355","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T02:53:02Z","registered":"2022-02-21T02:53:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-12-22T02:26:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To take advantage of such graphs, one must be able to find patterns, outliers and communities. These tasks are better performed in an interactive environment, where human expertise can guide the process. For large graphs, though, there are some challenges: the excessive processing requirements are prohibitive, and drawing hundred-thousand nodes results in cluttered images hard to comprehend. To cope with these problems, we propose an innovative framework suited for any kind of tree-like graph visual design. GMine integrates (a) a representation for graphs organized as hierarchies of partitions - the concepts of SuperGraph and Graph-Tree; and (b) a graph summarization methodology - CEPS. Our graph representation deals with the problem of tracing the connection aspects of a graph hierarchy with sub linear complexity, allowing one to grasp the neighborhood of a single node or of a group of nodes in a single click. As a proof of concept, the visual environment of GMine is instantiated as a system in which large graphs can be investigated globally and locally.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07777","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T03:42:57Z","registered":"2022-03-08T03:43:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T03:43:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The analysis considers a linearised porosity boundary condition where the seepage velocity through the aerofoil is related to the local pressure jump across the aerofoil surface and to the unsteady characteristics of the porous medium. Application of the Plemelj formulae to the resulting boundary value problem yields a singular Fredholm--Volterra integral equation which does not admit an analytic solution. Accordingly, we develop a numerical solution scheme by expanding the bound vorticity distribution in terms of appropriate basis functions. Asymptotic analysis at the leading- and trailing-edges reveals that the appropriate basis functions are weighted Jacobi polynomials whose parameters are related to the porosity distribution. The Jacobi polynomial basis enables the construction of a numerical scheme that is accurate and rapid, in contrast to the standard choice of Chebyshev basis functions that are shown to {be unsuitable} for porous aerofoils. Applications of the numerical solution scheme to discontinuous porosity profiles, quasi-static problems, and the separation of circulatory and non-circulatory contributions are presented. Analogues to the classical Theodorsen and Sears functions are computed numerically, which show that an effect of trailing-edge porosity is to reduce the amount of vorticity shed into the wake, thereby reducing the magnitude of the circulatory lift. {Fourier transform inversion of these frequency-domain functions produces porous extensions to the Wagner and K\u00fcssner functions for transient aerofoil motions or gust encounters, respectively.}","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"39 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07382","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T10:47:05Z","registered":"2022-02-27T10:47:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T10:47:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We discuss in detail the Holevo Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound, the Quantum Local Asymptotic Normality approach as well as Bayesian methods. Even though the fundamental concepts in the field have been laid out more than forty years ago, a number of important results have appeared much more recently. Moreover, the field drew increased attention recently thanks to advances in practical quantum metrology proposals and implementations that often involve estimation of multiple parameters simultaneously. Since these topics are spread in the literature and often served in a very formal mathematical language, one of the main goals of this review is to provide a largely self-contained work that allows the reader to follow most of the derivations and get an intuitive understanding of the interrelations between different concepts using a set of simple yet representative examples involving qubit and Gaussian shift models.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Review paper, 69 pages.

Assuming that the gas clouds radiate due mainly to the free-free emission and/or optically thick, inverse Compton scattering, we calculate how the emissivity distributions develop with time. We find that (1) gas clouds, each of which has a ring-like or arc shape, are intermittently formed, and that (2) they slowly fall to the black hole, keeping nearly the Keplerian orbital velocity. These features support the dynamical properties of the gas clouds assumed in the spin measurement method proposed by Moriyama &amp; Mineshige 2015, but the radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk is larger than that of the marginally stable orbit (ISCO). Next, we examine how each gas cloud is observed by a distant observer by calculating the photon trajectories in the black hole space-time. The luminosity of the accretion flow exhibits significant time variations on different timescales, reflecting the time evolution of the gas density distributions. The relatively slow variations on the time durations of 0.08-0.10 sec is due to the formation and fall of gas clouds, while quasi-periodic flux peaks with short time intervals (0.01 sec) are due to the quasi-periodic enhancement of light from the non-axisymmetric arc-shaped clouds through the beaming effect. This may account for the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in black hole binaries. The observational implications and future issues are briefly discussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09386","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T21:10:23Z","registered":"2022-03-03T21:10:24Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T21:10:24Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is pointed out that the formation of PBH's should be particularly efficient during the QCD epoch due to a substantial reduction of pressure forces during adiabatic collapse, or equivalently, a significant decrease in the effective speed of sound during the color-confinement transition. Our considerations imply that for generic initial density perturbation spectra PBH mass functions are expected to exhibit a pronounced peak on the QCD-horizon mass scale $\\sim 1 M_{\\odot}$. This mass scale is roughly coincident with the estimated masses for compact objects recently observed in our galactic halo by the MACHO collaboration.

Wu, Phys. Rev. D 83, 121502(R) (2011)], a new kind of metric ansatz was found to fairly describe all already known black hole solutions in the ungauged Kaluza-Klein (KK) supergravity theories. That metric ansatz somewhat resembles to the famous Kerr-Schild (KS) form, but it is different from the KS one in two distinct aspects. That is, apart from a global conformal factor, the metric ansatz can be written as a vacuum background spacetime plus a \"perturbation\" modification term, the latter of which is associated with a timelike geodesic vector field rather than a null geodesic congruence in the usual KS ansatz. In this paper, we shall study this novel metric ansatz in detail, aiming at achieving some inspiration as to the construction of rotating charged AdS black holes with multiple charges in other gauged supergravity theories. In order to investigate the metric properties of the general KK-AdS solutions, in this paper we devise a new effective method, dubbed the background metric expansion method, which can be thought of as a generalization of the perturbation expansion method, to deal with the Lagrangian and all equations of motion. In addition to two previously known conditions, namely the timelike and geodesic properties of the vector, we get the three additional constraints via contracting the Maxwell and Einstein equations once or twice with this timelike geodesic vector. In particular, we find that these are a simple set of sufficient conditions to determine the vector and the dilaton scalar around the background metric, which is helpful in obtaining new exact solutions. With these five simplified equations in hand, we rederive the general rotating charged KK-(A)dS black hole solutions with spherical horizon topology and obtain new solutions with planar topology in all dimensions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, Revtex4.cls, version mathched with the published paper","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08930","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T12:50:45Z","registered":"2022-03-08T12:50:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T12:50:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

BoRG[z9-10] is the continuation of a multi-year pure-parallel near-IR and optical imaging campaign with the Wide Field Camera 3.

The absorbing material is mildly ionized, with a column density of 3.2$\\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, and does not appear to vary during the period of the X-ray observation. If the same material causes the optical reddening (E(B-V)$\\simeq$0.6 mag), it must be located outside the narrow line region with a dust-to-gas ratio similar to the average Galactic value. We detect significant variations of the Fe K$\u03b1$ line during the observational period. A broad Fe K$\u03b1$ line at $\\simeq$6.7 keV with a width of $\\sim$0.6 keV is detected in the low flux segment of the first 40 ks exposure, and is absent in the spectra of other segments; a narrow Fe K$\u03b1$ emission line $\\sim$6.4 keV with a width of $\\sim$0.1 keV is observed in the subsequent 20 ks segment, which has a count rate of 35% higher and is in the next day.

In particular, this shows that the stability threshold in finite regularity scales no worse than $\u03bd^{1/2}$ for 2D shear flows close to the Couette flow.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01831","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T23:18:29Z","registered":"2022-03-06T23:18:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T23:18:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A simple pulsatile output form is utilized to reproduce the most relevant cardiac features with a minimum number of parameters associated with left ventricle dynamics. Another source of critical uncertainty is the spatial heterogeneity of the aortic compliance which plays a key role in the propagation and damping of pulse waves generated at each cardiac cycle. A continuous representation of the aortic stiffness in the form of a generic random field of prescribed spatial correlation is then considered. Resorting to a stochastic sparse pseudospectral method, we investigate the spatial sensitivity of the pulse pressure and waves reflection magnitude with respect to the different model uncertainties. Results indicate that uncertainties related to the shape and magnitude of the prescribed inlet flow in the proximal aorta can lead to potent variation of both the mean value and standard deviation of blood flow velocity and pressure dynamics due to the interaction of different wave propagation and reflection features. These results have potential physiological and pathological implications. They will provide some guidance in clinical data acquisition and future coupling of arterial pulse wave propagation reduced-order model with more complex beating heart models.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06556","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T21:26:28Z","registered":"2022-03-05T21:26:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T21:26:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

First we discuss in detail the assumptions of a theorem by Nanopoulos and Weinberg on the CP asymmetry generated from the decay of massive particles. In light of this statement, we analyse some interesting models of Baryogenesis through RPV. We then explore, in the context of RPV SUSY, the possibility to generate the baryon asymmetry through the out-of-equilibrium decay of a metastable Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP), as proposed in \\cite{Cui:2012jh}. This setting is also motivated by the observed coincidence between the abundances of dark and baryonic matter. In this framework, we propose two models of out-of-equilibrium decay of a would-be cold relic, and compute the associated CP asymmetry. With a TeV-scale parent, the observed baryon abundance can be reproduced in these models when the stop is in the multi-TeV region. Furthermore, annihilation of the metastable particle into SM states must be characterised by a very weak coupling, $g\\sim 10^{-2}$ and by a heavy mediator $m_{med}\\sim 10$ TeV. These models can also accommodate stop masses far from the TeV scale, at the expense of weakening the explanation of the $\u03a9_{B}-\u03a9_{DM}$ coincidence.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages, 12 figures.

The BL Lac jets show smaller variations than quasars. Roughly half of the heavily observed jets show systematic position angle trends with time, and 20 show indications of oscillatory behavior. The time spans of the data sets are too short compared to the fitted periods (5 to 12 y), however, to reliably establish periodicity. The rapid changes and large jumps in position angle seen in many cases suggest that the superluminal AGN jet features occupy only a portion of the entire jet cross section, and may be energized portions of thin instability structures within the jet. We have derived vector proper motions for 887 moving features in 200 jets having at least five VLBA epochs. For 557 well-sampled features, there are sufficient data to additionally study possible accelerations. We find that the moving features are generally non-ballistic, with 70% of the well-sampled features showing either significant accelerations or non-radial motions. Inward motions are rare (2% of all features), are slow (&lt;0.1 mas per y), are more prevalent in BL Lac jets, and are typically found within 1 mas of the unresolved core feature. There is a general trend of increasing apparent speed with distance down the jet for both radio galaxies and BL Lac objects. In most jets, the speeds of the features cluster around a characteristic value, yet there is a considerable dispersion in the distribution.

It has been long speculated that magnetars are the engine powering repeating bursts from FRB sources, but no convincing evidence has been collected so far\\cite{sun19}. Recently, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered an active phase by emitting intense soft Gamma-ray bursts. One FRB-like event with two peaks (FRB 200428) and a luminosity slightly lower than the faintest extragalactic FRBs was detected from the source, in association with a soft Gamma-ray / hard X-ray flare. Here we report an eight-hour targeted radio observational campaign comprising four sessions and assisted by multi-wavelength (optical and hard X-rays) data. During the third session, 29 soft Gamma-ray repeater (SGR) bursts were detected in Gamma-ray energies. Throughout the observing period, we detected no single dispersed pulsed emission coincident with the arrivals of SGR bursts, but unfortunately we were not observing when the FRB was detected. The non-detection places a fluence upper limit that is eight orders of magnitude lower than the fluence of FRB 200428. Our results suggest that FRB -- SGR burst associations are rare. FRBs may be highly relativistic and geometrically beamed, or FRB-like events associated with SGR bursts may have narrow spectra and characteristic frequencies outside the observed band. It is also possible that the physical conditions required to achieve coherent radiation in SGR bursts are difficult to satisfy, and that only under extreme conditions could an FRB be associated with an SGR burst.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"27 pages, 7 figures, Published in Nature 2020, Vol 587","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11479","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T18:32:40Z","registered":"2022-02-25T18:32:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T18:32:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the presence of model uncertainties or disturbances, for many control applications it suffices to keep the state constraints at least for a prescribed share of the time, as e.g. in building climate control or load mitigation for wind turbines. For such systems, a new control method of Scenario-Based Model Predictive Control (SCMPC) is presented in this paper. It optimizes the control inputs over a finite horizon, subject to robust constraint satisfaction under a finite number of random scenarios of the uncertainty and/or disturbances. While previous approaches have shown to be conservative (i.e. to stay far below the specified rate of constraint violations), the new method is the first to account for the special structure of the MPC problem in order to significantly reduce the number of scenarios. In combination with a new framework for interpreting the probabilistic constraints as average-in-time, rather than pointwise-in-time, the conservatism is eliminated.

As such, there is no reason for expecting the applicability of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. Some of these phenomena appear to follow, instead, nonextensive statistical mechanics. In the same manner that the BG formalism is based on the entropy $S_{BG}=-k \\sum_i p_i \\ln p_i$, the nonextensive one is based on the form $S_q=k(1-\\sum_ip_i^q)/(q-1)$ (with $S_1=S_{BG}$). The stationary states of the former are characterized by an {\\it exponential} dependence on the energy, whereas those of the latter are characterized by an (asymptotic) {\\it power-law}. A brief review of this theory is given here, as well as of some of its applications, such as the solar neutrino problem, polytropic self-gravitating systems, galactic peculiar velocities, cosmic rays and some cosmological aspects. In addition to these, an analogy with the Keplerian elliptic orbits {\\it versus} the Ptolemaic epicycles is developed, where we show that optimizing $S_q$ with a few constraints is equivalent to optimizing $S_{BG}$ with an infinite number of constraints.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages including one EPS figure.

Since person ReID data contains sensitive personal information, researchers have adopted federated learning, an emerging distributed training method, to mitigate the privacy leakage risks. However, existing studies rely on data labels that are laborious and time-consuming to obtain. We present FedUReID, a federated unsupervised person ReID system to learn person ReID models without any labels while preserving privacy. FedUReID enables in-situ model training on edges with unlabeled data. A cloud server aggregates models from edges instead of centralizing raw data to preserve data privacy. Moreover, to tackle the problem that edges vary in data volumes and distributions, we personalize training in edges with joint optimization of cloud and edge. Specifically, we propose personalized epoch to reassign computation throughout training, personalized clustering to iteratively predict suitable labels for unlabeled data, and personalized update to adapt the server aggregated model to each edge. Extensive experiments on eight person ReID datasets demonstrate that FedUReID not only achieves higher accuracy but also reduces computation cost by 29%. Our FedUReID system with the joint optimization will shed light on implementing federated learning to more multimedia tasks without data labels.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"ACMMM'21","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06493","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T00:21:14Z","registered":"2022-02-21T00:21:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T00:21:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the absence of an intrinsic velocity gradient (e.g., due to rotation or streaming), an observed gradient in the heliocentric rest frame (HRF) relates simply to a dSph's systemic proper motion (PM). Kinematic samples for the Milky Way's brightest dSph satellites are now sufficiently large that we can use stellar redshifts to constrain systemic PMs independently of astrometric data. Data from our Michigan/MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) Survey reveal significant HRF velocity gradients in Carina, Fornax and Sculptor, and no significant gradient in Sextans. Assuming there are no intrinsic gradients, the data provide a relatively tight constraint on the PM of Fornax, (mu_{alpha}^{HRF},mu_{delta}^{HRF})=(+48 +/- 15,-25 +/- 14) mas/century, that agrees with published HST astrometric measurements. Smaller data sets yield weaker constraints in the remaining galaxies, but our Carina measurement, (mu_{alpha}^{HRF},mu_{delta}^{HRF})=(+25 +/- 36,+16 +/- 43) mas/century, agrees with the published astrometric value. The disagreement of our Sculptor measurement, (mu_{alpha}^{HRF},mu_{delta}^{HRF})= (-40 +/- 29, -69 +/- 47) mas/century, with astrometric measurements is expected if Sculptor has a rotational component as reported by Battaglia et al. (2008). For Sextans, which at present lacks an astrometric measurement, we measure (mu_{alpha}^{HRF},mu_{delta}^{HRF})=(-26 +/- 41, +10 +/- 44) mas/century.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for Publication by ApJ Letters","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1511","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T16:02:37Z","registered":"2022-03-15T16:02:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T16:02:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\u0394$ region.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"27 pages, 16 figures, accepted version in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05212","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-05-09T01:37:17Z","registered":"2024-05-09T01:37:18Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-12-18T03:27:26Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Asteroseismic data have been obtained by Kepler in short cadence. The spectroscopic parameters are based on spectra taken as part of APOGEE and correspond to DR13 of SDSS. We analyze our data using two Teff scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those derived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results arising from these choices as a test of systematic Teff, and find that they can lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties. Determinations of surface gravity ($\\log{g}$), mean density ($\u03c1$), radius ($R$), mass ($M$), and age ($\u03c4$) for the whole sample have been carried out with stellar grid-based modeling. We have assessed random and systematic error sources in the spectroscopic and seismic data, as well as in the grid-based modeling determination of the stellar quantities in the catalog. We provide stellar properties for both Teff scales. The median combined (random and systematic) uncertainties are 2% (0.01 dex; $\\log{g}$), 3.4% ($\u03c1$), 2.6% ($R$), 5.1% ($M$), and 19% ($\u03c4$) for the photometric Teff scale and 2% ($\\log{g}$), 3.5% ($\u03c1$), 2.7% ($R$), 6.3% ($M$), and 23% ($\u03c4$) for the spectroscopic scale. Comparisons with stellar quantities in the catalog by Chaplin et al.(2014) highlight the importance of metallicity measurements for determining stellar parameters accurately. We compare our results with those from other sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good agreement in all cases. Comparisons give strong support to the determination of stellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future missions such as TESS and PLATO.

Building on these CG models we derive force-fields to investigate the [C_{2-8}MIM] [BF4] family of ionic liquids, as a starting step for systematic investigations of lubrication under nanoconfinement conditions. The simualted equation of state and diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with experimental data and with all-atom force fields. We use these model to analyze the nano nanostructuring of ILs characteristic of cations with longer aliphatic chains as well as the ILs liquidvapour interfacial structure. The CG nature of these models enables the simulation of very long time scales, which are needed to computer reliable results of dynamic and interfacial properties. For [C&gt;4MIM] [BF4] the break in symmetry associated to the liquid-vapor interface induces nanostructuring in polar and non-polar domains in the direction perpendicular to the interface plane, hence mimicking the behavior observed in the bulk phases.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"29 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09032","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T02:01:49Z","registered":"2022-02-27T02:01:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T02:01:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is currently not known experimentally for any particle, but the D-term of the nucleon can be inferred from studies of hard-exclusive reactions. In this work we show that the D-term of a spin-1/2 fermion is of dynamical origin: it vanishes for a free fermion. This is in pronounced contrast to the bosonic case where already a free spin-0 boson has a non-zero intrinsic D-term as shown in an accompanying work. We illustrate in two simple models how interactions generate the D-term of a fermion with an internal structure, the nucleon. All known matter is composed of elementary fermions. This indicates the importance to study this interesting particle property in more detail, which will provide novel insights especially on the structure of the nucleon.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05317","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T05:24:15Z","registered":"2022-03-03T05:24:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T05:24:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

While general advice on the design and analysis of neutral benchmark studies can be found in recent literature, certain amounts of flexibility always exist. This includes the choice of data sets and performance measures, the handling of missing performance values and the way the performance values are aggregated over the data sets. As a consequence of this flexibility, researchers may be concerned about how their choices affect the results or, in the worst case, may be tempted to engage in questionable research practices (e.g. the selective reporting of results or the post-hoc modification of design or analysis components) to fit their expectations or hopes. To raise awareness for this issue, we use an example benchmark study to illustrate how variable benchmark results can be when all possible combinations of a range of design and analysis options are considered. We then demonstrate how the impact of each choice on the results can be assessed using multidimensional unfolding. In conclusion, based on previous literature and on our illustrative example, we claim that the multiplicity of design and analysis options combined with questionable research practices lead to biased interpretations of benchmark results and to over-optimistic conclusions. This issue should be considered by computational researchers when designing and analysing their benchmark studies and by the scientific community in general in an effort towards more reliable benchmark results.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"39 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02447","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T04:27:18Z","registered":"2022-02-21T04:27:24Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-01-17T05:53:26Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The heart of the program is a neural network in form of Kohonen's self-organizing map. The resulting map is designed as an icon map suitable for the inspection by eye. The visual analysis is supported by the option to blend in individual object properties such as redshift, apparent magnitude, or signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, the package provides several tools for the selection of special spectral types, e.g. local difference maps which reflect the deviations of all spectra from one given input spectrum (real or artificial). ASPECT is able to produce a two-dimensional topological map of a huge number of spectra. The software package enables the user to browse and navigate through a huge data pool and helps him to gain an insight into underlying relationships between the spectra and other physical properties and to get the big picture of the entire data set. We demonstrate the capability of ASPECT by clustering the entire data pool of 0.6 million spectra from the Data Release 4 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To illustrate the results regarding quality and completeness we track objects from existing catalogues of quasars and carbon stars, respectively, and connect the SDSS spectra with morphological information from the GalaxyZoo project.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 14 figures; accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3615","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T19:54:02Z","registered":"2022-03-11T19:54:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T19:54:03Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The influence of the basin boundaries and possible deviations from Gaussianity in the white noise state are considered in order to approximate conditions attainable in the laboratory.

We demonstrate the feasibility of implementation of such strategies in the current Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public alert data stream. We compare the performance of two AL strategies: uncertainty sampling and random sampling. Our pipeline consists of 3 stages: feature extraction, classification and learning strategy. Starting from an initial sample of 10 alerts (5 SN Ia and 5 non-Ia), we let the algorithm identify which alert should be added to the training sample. The system is allowed to evolve through 300 iterations. Our data set consists of 23 840 alerts from the ZTF with confirmed classification via cross-match with SIMBAD database and the Transient name server (TNS), 1 600 of which were SNe Ia (1 021 unique objects). The data configuration, after the learning cycle was completed, consists of 310 alerts for training and 23 530 for testing. Averaging over 100 realizations, the classifier achieved 89% purity and 54% efficiency. From 01/November/2020 to 31/October/2021 Fink has applied its early supernova Ia module to the ZTF stream and communicated promising SN Ia candidates to the TNS. From the 535 spectroscopically classified Fink candidates, 459 (86%) were proven to be SNe Ia. Our results confirm the effectiveness of active learning strategies for guiding the construction of optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. It demonstrates in real data that the performance of learning algorithms can be highly improved without the need of extra computational resources or overwhelmingly large training samples. This is, to our knowledge, the first application of AL to real alerts data.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11438","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-20T02:41:55Z","registered":"2022-02-20T02:41:56Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-07-07T01:13:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The classical version of this problem was solved by Slepian and Wolf, who showed that distributed compression could take full advantage of redundancy in the local sources created by the presence of correlations. We show that, in general, this is not the case for quantum sources by proving a lower bound on the rate sum for irreducible sources of product states which is stronger than the one given by a naive application of Slepian-Wolf. Nonetheless, strategies taking advantage of correlation do exist for some special classes of quantum sources. For example, Devetak and Winter demonstrated the existence of such a strategy when one of the sources is classical. Here we find optimal non-trivial strategies for a different extreme, sources of Bell states. In addition, we illustrate how distributed compression is connected to other problems in quantum information theory, including information-disturbance questions, entanglement distillation and quantum error correction.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages. v3 corrects an error in the section on irreducible product sources","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403042","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T15:59:36Z","registered":"2022-03-18T15:59:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T15:59:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For models with a uniform non-zero mass spectrum we demonstrate that the resulting double-copy factors on physical poles and that up to at least 5-particle scattering, color-kinematics satisfying numerators always exist. For the scattering of 5 or more particles, the procedure generically introduces spurious singularities that must be cancelled by imposing additional constraints. When massive particles are present, color-kinematics duality is not enough to guarantee a physical double-copy. As an example, we apply the formalism to massive Yang-Mills and show that up to 4-particle scattering the double-copy construction generates physical amplitudes of a model of dRGT massive gravity coupled to a dilaton and a two-form with dilaton parity violating couplings. We show that the spurious singularities in the 5-particle double-copy do not cancel in this example, and the construction fails to generate physically sensible amplitudes. We conjecture sufficient constraints on the mass spectrum, which in addition to massive BCJ relations, guarantee the absence of spurious singularities.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"48 pages, 1 figure","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12948","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T20:36:10Z","registered":"2022-02-26T20:36:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T20:36:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

HCN emission is the signature of dense molecular gas found in GMC cores, the actual sites of massive star formation. We have made the first detection of HCN in a submillimeter galaxy, SMM J16359+6612. The HCN emission is seen with a signal to noise ratio of 4$\u03c3$ and appears to be resolved as a double-source of $\\approxlt 2''$ separation. Our new HCN observations, combined with previous HCN detections and upper limits, show that the FIR/HCN ratios in these high redshift sources lie systematically above the FIR/HCN correlation established for nearby galaxies by about a factor of 2. Even considering the scatter in the data and the presence of upper limits, this is an indication that the FIR/HCN ratios for the early Universe molecular emission line galaxies (EMGs) deviate from the correlation that fits Galactic giant molecular cloud cores, normal spirals, LIRGs, and ULIRGs. This indicates that the star formation rate per solar mass of dense molecular gas is higher in the high-$z$ objects than in local galaxies including normal spirals LIRGs and ULIRGs. The limited HCN detections at high-redshift show that the HCN/CO ratios for the high-$z$ objects are high and are comparable to those of the local ULIRGs rather than those of normal spirals. This indicates that EMGs have a high fraction of dense molecular gas compared to total molecular gas traced by CO emission.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages including 4 figures; ApJL accepted","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703548","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T04:34:43Z","registered":"2022-03-16T04:34:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T20:52:39Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Although there are several well-known phase retrieval algorithms including the hybrid input-output (HIO) method, the reconstruction performance is generally sensitive to initialization and measurement noise. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to provide state-of-the-art performance in solving several inverse problems such as denoising, deconvolution, and superresolution. In this work, we develop a phase retrieval algorithm that utilizes two DNNs together with the model-based HIO method. First, a DNN is trained to remove the HIO artifacts and is used iteratively with the HIO method to improve the reconstructions. After this iterative phase, a second DNN is trained to remove the remaining artifacts. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of ourapproach, which has little additional computational cost compared to the HIO method. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance but also is more robust to different initialization and noise levels.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 8 figures, published in Applied Optics (Vol. 58, Issue 20, pp. 5422-5431 (2019))","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11301","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T08:33:10Z","registered":"2022-02-28T08:33:11Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T08:33:11Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This information is valuable for a variety of applications such as geotechnical characterization of the near-surface, seismic hazard evaluation, and groundwater monitoring. However, for such processes to converge quickly, data segments with appropriate noise energy should be selected. Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a novel sensing technique that enables acquisition of these data at very high spatial and temporal resolution for tens of kilometers. One major challenge when utilizing the DAS technology is the large volume of data that is produced, thereby presenting a significant Big Data challenge to find regions of useful energy. In this work, we present a highly scalable and efficient approach to process real, complex DAS data by integrating physics knowledge acquired during a data exploration phase followed by deep supervised learning to identify \"useful\" coherent surface waves generated by anthropogenic activity, a class of seismic waves that is abundant on these recordings and is useful for geophysical imaging. Data exploration and training were done on 130~Gigabytes (GB) of DAS measurements. Using parallel computing, we were able to do inference on an additional 170~GB of data (or the equivalent of 10 days' worth of recordings) in less than 30 minutes. Our method provides interpretable patterns describing the interaction of ground-based human activities with the buried sensors.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted at the IEEE BigData 2020 conference","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10352","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T12:57:44Z","registered":"2022-02-24T12:57:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T12:57:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Therefore, how to improve the performance of link prediction with the aid of structural properties of networks is an essential problem. By analyzing many real networks, we find a common structure property: nodes are preferentially linked to the nodes with the weak clique structure (abbreviated as PWCS to simplify descriptions). Based on this PWCS phenomenon, we propose a local friend recommendation (FR) index to facilitate link prediction. Our experiments show that the performance of FR index is generally better than some famous local similarity indices, such as Common Neighbor (CN) index, Adamic-Adar (AA) index and Resource Allocation (RA) index. We then explain why PWCS can give rise to the better performance of FR index in link prediction. Finally, a mixed friend recommendation index (labelled MFR) is proposed by utilizing the PWCS phenomenon, which further improves the accuracy of link prediction.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 figures, 4 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05146","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T20:22:45Z","registered":"2022-03-06T20:22:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T20:22:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We further develop a simple stripping model predicting the kinematics of stripped-off stars. We show that the distribution of orbital energies in the tidal debris has a typical form which can be described quite accurately by a simple function. Based on this we develop a method to predict the energy distribution which allows us to evaluate the significance and the implications of high velocity stars in satellite tidal debris. Generally tidal collisions of satellite galaxy produce stars which escape into the intragalactic space even if the satellite itself is on a bound orbit. The main parameters determining the maximum energy kick a tidal debris star can get is the initial mass of the satellite and only to a lower extent its orbit. Main contributors to an unbound stellar population created in this way are massive satellites (M_sat &gt; 10^9 M_sun). We thus expect intragalactic stars to have a metallicity higher than the surviving satellite population of the Milky Way. However, the probability that the observed HVS population is significantly contaminated by tidal debris stars appears small in the light of our results.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0823","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T19:06:40Z","registered":"2022-03-12T19:06:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T19:06:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This distribution extends over three orders of magnitude, from 0.01 Lsun - 69 Lsun, and has a mean and median of 4.3 Lsun and 1.3 Lsun, respectively. The distributions are very similar for Class 0 and Class I sources except for an excess of low luminosity (Lbol &lt; 0.5 Lsun) Class I sources compared to Class 0. 100 out of the 230 protostars (43%) lack any available data in the far-infrared and submillimeter (70 um &lt; wavelength &lt; 850 um) and have Lbol underestimated by factors of 2.5 on average, and up to factors of 8-10 in extreme cases. Correcting these underestimates for each source individually once additional data becomes available will likely increase both the mean and median of the sample by 35% - 40%. We discuss and compare our results to several recent theoretical studies of protostellar luminosities and show that our new results do not invalidate the conclusions of any of these studies.

The onset of absorption, band I and also band IV, is resolved into broad vibrational peaks, which contrast with the continuous absorption previously claimed. A new theoretical analysis, using a combination of time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations and complete active space self-consistent field, leads to a major new interpretation. Adiabatic excitation energies (AEEs) and vertical excitation energies, evaluated by these methods, are used to interpret the spectra in unprecedented detail using theoretical vibronic analysis. This includes both Franck-Condon (FC) and Herzberg-Teller (HT) effects on cold and hot bands. These results lead to the re-assignment of several known excited states and the identification of new ones. The lowest calculated AEE sequence for singlet states is 1$^1$B$_1$ $\\sim$ 1$^1$A$_2$ &lt; 2$^1$B$_1$ &lt; 1$^1$A$_1$ &lt; 2$^1$A$_1$ &lt; 1$^1$B$_2$ &lt; 3$^1$A$_1$ &lt; 3$^1$B$_1$. These, together with calculated higher energy states, give a satisfactory account of the principal maxima observed in the VUV spectrum. Basis sets up to quadruple zeta valence with extensive polarization are used. The diffuse functions within this type of basis generate both valence and low-lying Rydberg excited states. The optimum position for the site of further diffuse functions in the calculations of Rydberg states is shown to lie on the H-atoms. The routine choice on the F-atoms is shown to be inadequate for both CHF$_3$ and CH$_2$F$_2$. The lowest excitation energy region has mixed valence and Rydberg character. TDDFT calculations show that the unusual structure of the onset arises from the near degeneracy of 1$^1$B$_1$ and 1$^1$A$_2$ valence states, which mix in symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Manuscript and Supporting Material","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13354","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-07-26T01:37:02Z","registered":"2023-07-26T01:37:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-07-26T01:37:02Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We modify the gravity sector by allowing quantum corrections motivated from (1) local $f(R)$ gravity and (2) non-minimally coupled gravity with SM sector and dilaton field. Next we apply conformal transformation on the metric to transform the action back to the Einstein frame. We also show that an effective theory constructed from these extended theories of gravity and SM sector looks exactly the same. Using the relic constraint observed by Planck 2015, we constrain the scale of the effective field theory ($\u039b_{UV}$) as well as the dark matter mass ($M$). We consider two cases- (1) light dark matter (LDM) and (2) heavy dark matter (HDM), and deduce upper bounds on thermally averaged cross section of dark matter annihilating to SM particles. Further we show that our model naturally incorporates self interactions of dark matter. Using these self interactions, we derive the constraints on the parameters of the (1) local $f(R)$ gravity and (2) non-minimally coupled gravity from dark matter self interaction. Finally, we propose some different UV complete models from a particle physics point of view, which can give rise to the same effective theory that we have deduced from extended theories of gravity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"45 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication in European Physical Journal C","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08176","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T01:06:04Z","registered":"2022-03-07T01:06:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T01:06:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Since modeling all the possible world interactions is unfeasible, learning from experience is required, posing the challenge of collecting a large amount of experiences (i.e., training data). Typically, a manipulative robot operates on external objects by using its own hands (or similar end-effectors), but in some cases the use of tools may be desirable, nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that while a robot can collect many sensorimotor experiences using its own hands, this cannot happen for all possible human-made tools. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the developmental transition from hand to tool affordances: what sensorimotor skills that a robot has acquired with its bare hands can be employed for tool use? By employing a visual and motor imagination mechanism to represent different hand postures compactly, we propose a probabilistic model to learn hand affordances, and we show how this model can generalize to estimate the affordances of previously unseen tools, ultimately supporting planning, decision-making and tool selection tasks in humanoid robots. We present experimental results with the iCub humanoid robot, and we publicly release the collected sensorimotor data in the form of a hand posture affordances dataset.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"dataset available at htts://vislab.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/, IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and on Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL-EpiRob 2017)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03022","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T17:21:40Z","registered":"2022-03-02T17:21:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T17:21:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We then construct the LP-index policy that is asymptotically optimal with square root convergence rate on all models, and with exponential rate if the model is non-degenerate in finite horizon, and satisfies a uniform global attractor property in infinite horizon. We next define the LP-update policy, which is essentially a repeated LP-index policy that solves a new linear program at each decision epoch. We provide numerical experiments to compare the efficiency of LP-based policies. We compare the performance of the LP-index policy and the LP-update policy with other heuristics. Our result demonstrates that the LP-update policy outperforms the LP-index policy in general, and can have a significant advantage when the transition matrices are wrongly estimated.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Mathematics of Operations Research, 2023","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10067","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-23T05:40:26Z","registered":"2022-02-23T05:40:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-12-25T02:36:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Since Curry is statically typed, our emphasis on this SQL integration is on type safety. Our extension respects the type system of Curry so that run-time errors due to ill-typed data are avoided. This is obtained by preprocessing SQL statements at compile time and translating them into type-safe database access operations. As a consequence, the type checker of the Curry system can spot type errors in SQL statements at compile time. To generate appropriately typed access operations, the preprocessor uses an entity-relationship (ER) model describing the structure of the relational data. In addition to standard SQL, SQL statements embedded in Curry can include program expressions and also relationships specified in the ER model. The latter feature is useful to avoid the error-prone use of foreign keys. As a result, our SQL integration supports a high-level and type-safe access to databases in Curry programs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"In Proceedings WLP'15/'16/WFLP'16, arXiv:1701.00148","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00631","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T15:25:59Z","registered":"2022-03-04T15:26:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T15:26:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Such experiments can indeed complement observations by providing access to the processes with spatial and temporal resolution. A first step has been made in [G. Revet et al., Science Advances 3, e1700982 (2017), arXiv:1708.02528]. in allowing such investigations. It revealed the existence of a two components stream: a hot shell surrounding a cooler inner stream. The shell was formed by matter laterally ejected upon impact and refocused by the local magnetic field. That laboratory investigation was limited tonormal incidence impacts. However, in young stellar objects, complex structure of magnetic fields causes variability of the incidentangles of the accretion columns. This led us to undertake an investigation, using laboratory plasmas, of the consequence of having a slanted accretion impacting a young star. Here we use high power laser interactions and strong magnetic field generation in the laboratory, complemented by numerical simulations, to study the asymmetry induced upon accretion structures when columns of matter impact the surface of young stars with an oblique angle. Compared to the scenario where matter accretes normal to the star surface, we observe strongly asymmetric plasma structure, strong lateral ejecta of matter, poor confinement of the accreted material and reduced heating compared to the normal incidence case. Thus, slanted accretion is a configuration that seems to be capable of inducing perturbations of the chromosphere and hence possibly influence the level of activity of the corona.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10735","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T11:39:28Z","registered":"2022-02-25T11:39:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T11:39:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For solving the problem, we introduce a multi-view embedding in which a latent factorization identifies which aspects in the two data views (primary data and user data) are related and which are specific to only one of them. The factorization is a generative model in which the display is parameterized as a part of the factorization and the other factors explain away the aspects not expressible in a two-dimensional display.

Using a general single level model going beyond the Lorentzian transmission limit, in this work we present a rigorous demonstration that this is not the case. In particular, we deduce an analytical for the bias ($V$) driven shift of the level energy $\u03b4\\varepsilon_{0}(V)$ showing that $\u03b4\\varepsilon_{0}(V)/V$ scales as $\u0393_t/W_t - \u0393_s/W_s$, which is merely a tiny quantity because the electrode bandwidths $W_{s,t}$ are much larger than $\u0393_{s,t}$. This result invalidates a previous, never-deduced formula in use in some previous publications that neither could be justified theoretically nor is supported by experiment.

A lattice of size L X L can have at most L-1 quantized vortices in the lowest Bloch band. In contrast to homogeneous systems, angular momentum is not a good quantum number since the continuous rotational symmetry is broken by the lattice. Instead, a quasi-angular momentum captures the discrete rotational symmetry of the system.

The approach uses q-deformed oscillators and the related picture of ideal gas of q-bosons. In effect, the intercept \u03bbis connected with deformation parameter q.

In this paper, we present a review of active learning through deep active learning approaches from the following perspectives: 1) technical advancements in active learning, 2) applications of active learning in computer vision, 3) industrial systems leveraging or with potential to leverage active learning for data iteration, 4) current limitations and future research directions.

In this letter, we focus on the efficiency of AUV vision for real-time and low-light object detection. First, we improved the efficiency of a class of state-of-the-art object detectors, namely EfficientDets, by 1.5% AP on D0, 2.6% AP on D1, 1.2% AP on D2 and 1.3% AP on D3 without increasing the GPU latency. Subsequently, we created and made publicly available a dataset for the detection of in-water plastic bags and bottles and trained our improved EfficientDets on this and another dataset for marine debris detection. Finally, we investigated how the detector performance is affected by low-light conditions and compared two low-light underwater image enhancement strategies both in terms of accuracy and latency.

Herders always select the majority of the previous $r$ votes, which is visible to them. We call them digital herders. We can accurately calculate the distribution of votes for special cases. When r&gt;=3, we find that a phase transition occurs at the upper limit of t, where t is the discrete time (or number of votes). As the fraction of herders increases, the model features a phase transition beyond which a state where most voters make the correct choice coexists with one where most of them are wrong. On the other hand, when r&lt;3, there is no phase transition. In this case, the herders' performance is the same as that of the independent voters.

The UV grism covers the range 1700-5000 Angstrom with a spectral resolution of 75 at 2600 Angstrom for source magnitudes of u=10-16 mag, while the visible grism covers the range 2850-6600 Angstrom with a spectral resolution of 100 at 4000 Angstrom for source magnitudes of b=12-17 mag. This calibration extends over all detector positions, for all modes used during operations. The wavelength accuracy (1-sigma) is 9 Angstrom in the UV grism clocked mode, 17 Angstrom in the UV grism nominal mode and 22 Angstrom in the visible grism. The range below 2740 Angstrom in the UV grism and 5200 Angstrom in the visible grism never suffers from overlapping by higher spectral orders. The flux calibration of the grisms includes a correction we developed for coincidence loss in the detector. The error in the coincidence loss correction is less than 20%. The position of the spectrum on the detector only affects the effective area (sensitivity) by a few percent in the nominal modes, but varies substantially in the clocked modes. The error in the effective area is from 9% in the UV grism clocked mode to 15% in the visible grism clocked mode .","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"27 pages, 31 figures; MNRAS accepted 23 February 2015","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02433","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T01:49:39Z","registered":"2022-03-09T01:49:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T01:49:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We address this gap with our differentiable simulation tool by learning the material parameters of our soft robotic fish. On the example of a soft robotic fish, we demonstrate an experimentally-verified, fast optimization pipeline for learning the material parameters from quasi-static data via differentiable simulation and apply it to the prediction of dynamic performance. Our method identifies physically plausible Young's moduli for various soft silicone elastomers and stiff acetal copolymers used in creation of our three different robotic fish tail designs. We show that our method is compatible with varying internal geometry of the actuators, such as the number of hollow cavities. Our framework allows high fidelity prediction of dynamic behavior for composite bi-morph bending structures in real hardware to millimeter-accuracy and within 3 percent error normalized to actuator length. We provide a differentiable and robust estimate of the thrust force using a neural network thrust predictor; this estimate allows for accurate modeling of our experimental setup measuring bollard pull. This work presents a prototypical hardware and simulation problem solved using our differentiable framework; the framework can be applied to higher dimensional parameter inference, learning control policies, and computational design due to its differentiable character.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Published at IROS 2022. 8 pages, 9 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14855","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":4,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T12:48:17Z","registered":"2022-02-21T12:48:18Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-08-09T01:22:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For the latter we suggest a closure, which makes the truncation, for small noise, a rigorous first-order correction to the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, and simultaneously is a generalization of the Gaussian ansatz. The Kuramoto model with intrinsic noise, and the population of identical noisy active rotators in excitable states with the Kuramoto-type coupling, are considered as examples to test validity of these approximations. For all considered cases, the Gaussian ansatz is found to be more accurate than the Ott-Antonsen one for high-synchrony states only.

We here develop a generic formalism for the fifth force effect in theories involving massive scalar fields arising from e.g. string theory. With PSR J0337 measurements, we find the strongest bound on the simplest theory with a massive scalar field beyond general relativity and derive new constraints in other theories with axions, dark matter mediators, and higher-curvature corrections.

Localized \"equatorial $\u03b2$-plane\" simulations by Fromang et al. (2016) have revealed that a barotropic (horizontal shear) instability of the equatorial jet appears at horizontal resolutions beyond those typically achieved in global models; this instability could limit wind speeds and lead to increased atmospheric variability. To address this possibility, we adapt the computationally efficient, pseudo-spectral PlaSim GCM, originally designed for Earth studies, to model Hot Jupiter atmospheric flows and validate it on the Heng et al. (2011) reference benchmark. We then present high resolution global models of HD209458b, with horizontal resolutions of T85 (128x256) and T127 (192x384). The barotropic instability phenomenology found in $\u03b2$-plane simulations is not reproduced in these global models, despite comparably high resolutions. Nevertheless, high resolution models do exhibit additional flow variability on long timescales (of order 100 planet days or more), which is absent from the lower resolution models. It manifests as a breakdown of north-south symmetry of the equatorial wind. From post-processing the atmospheric flows at various resolutions (assuming a cloud-free situation), we show that the stronger flow variability achieved at high resolution does not translate into noticeably stronger dayside infrared flux variability. More generally, our results suggest that high horizontal resolutions are not required to capture the key features of hot Jupiter atmospheric flows.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00084","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T19:10:56Z","registered":"2022-02-26T19:10:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T19:10:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The study focused on the influence of virtual research and development teams within Malaysian manufacturing small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The specific objective of the study is better understanding of the application of collaborative technologies in business, to find the effective factors to assist SMEs to remain competitive in the future. The paper stresses to find an answer for a question Is there any relationship between company size, Internet connection facility and virtuality?. The survey data shows SMEs are now technologically capable of performing the virtual collaborative team, but the infrastructure usage is less. SMEs now have the necessary technology to begin the implementation process of collaboration tools to reduce research and development time, costs and increase productivity. So, the manager of R and D should take the potentials of virtual teams into account.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7889","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T21:59:05Z","registered":"2022-03-11T21:59:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T21:59:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These works assume that the relevant video is already known and attempt to localize the moment on that relevant video only. Different from such works, we relax this assumption and address the task of localizing moments in a corpus of videos for a given sentence query. This task poses a unique challenge as the system is required to perform: (i) retrieval of the relevant video where only a segment of the video corresponds with the queried sentence, and (ii) temporal localization of moment in the relevant video based on sentence query. Towards overcoming this challenge, we propose Hierarchical Moment Alignment Network (HMAN) which learns an effective joint embedding space for moments and sentences. In addition to learning subtle differences between intra-video moments, HMAN focuses on distinguishing inter-video global semantic concepts based on sentence queries. Qualitative and quantitative results on three benchmark text-based video moment retrieval datasets - Charades-STA, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet Captions - demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance on the proposed task of temporal localization of moments in a corpus of videos.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08716","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T19:43:14Z","registered":"2022-02-25T19:43:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T19:43:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the case of virion cells, substantial extinction power, counting both absorbing and scattering effects, is a prerequisite for performing a variety of coupling actions against the viral particles and, thus, a highly sought-after feature. By considering realistic dispersion for the dielectric permittivity of proteins and a core-shell modeling allowing for rigorous formulation via Mie theory, we report optical extinction resonances for corona-virions at mid-infrared range that are not significantly perturbed by changes in the objects size or the background host. Our findings indicate the optimal regime for interaction of photonic radiation with viral particles and may assist towards the development of equipment for thermal damage, disintegration or neutralization of coronavirus cells.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 7 figures.

The achievable rate regions of these schemes go well beyond the capacity region of the AWGN-BC without feedback. In this paper, a concatenating coding design for the $K$-user AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is proposed that relies on linear feedback schemes to achieve rate tuples outside the no-feedback capacity region. Specifically, a linear feedback code for the AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is used as an inner code that creates an effective single-user channel from the transmitter to each of the receivers, and then open-loop coding is used for coding over these single-user channels. An achievable rate region of linear feedback schemes for noiseless feedback is shown to be achievable by the concatenated coding scheme for sufficiently small feedback noise level. Then, a linear feedback coding scheme for the $K$-user symmetric AWGN-BC with noisy feedback is presented and optimized for use in the concatenated coding scheme. Lastly, we apply the concatenated coding design to the two-user AWGN-BC with a single noisy feedback link from one of the receivers.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3290","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T16:13:56Z","registered":"2022-03-10T16:13:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T16:13:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The technique relies on a transformation of the classical nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation to a linear partial differential equation for a class of problems with a particular constraint on the stochastic forcing. This linear partial differential equation can then be relaxed to a linear differential inclusion, allowing for relaxed solutions to be generated using sum of squares programming. The resulting relaxed solutions are in fact viscosity super/subsolutions, and by the maximum principle are pointwise upper and lower bounds to the underlying value function, even for coarse polynomial approximations. Furthermore, the pointwise upper bound is shown to be a stochastic control Lyapunov function, yielding a method for generating nonlinear controllers with pointwise bounded distance from the optimal cost when using the optimal controller. These approximate solutions may be computed with non-increasing error via a hierarchy of semidefinite optimization problems. Finally, this paper develops a-priori bounds on trajectory suboptimality when using these approximate value functions, as well as demonstrates that these methods, and bounds, can be applied to a more general class of nonlinear systems not obeying the constraint on stochastic forcing. Simulated examples illustrate the methodology.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Published in SIAM Journal of Control and Optimization","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0405","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T23:00:18Z","registered":"2022-03-09T23:00:19Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T23:00:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the overlap framework, the computation of the fermion propagator leads to a nested iteration where the matrix vector multiplications in each step of an outer iteration have to be accomplished by an inner iteration; the latter approximates the product of the sign function of the hermitian Wilson fermion matrix with a vector. In this paper we investigate aspects of this nested paradigm. We examine several Krylov subspace methods to be used as an outer iteration for both propagator computations and the Hybrid Monte-Carlo scheme. We establish criteria on the accuracy of the inner iteration which allow to preserve an a priori given precision for the overall computation. It will turn out that the accuracy of the sign function can be relaxed as the outer iteration proceeds. Furthermore, we consider preconditioning strategies, where the preconditioner is built upon an inaccurate approximation to the sign function. Relaxation combined with preconditioning allows for considerable savings in computational efforts up to a factor of 4 as our numerical experiments illustrate. We also discuss the possibility of projecting the squared overlap operator into one chiral sector.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"33 Pages; citations added","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0405003","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T19:09:15Z","registered":"2022-03-18T19:09:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T19:09:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Empirical analyses of high-dimensional biomedical data, including genomics, proteomics, microbiome, and neuroimaging, among others, consistently reveal strong modularity in the dependence patterns. In these analyses, intercorrelated high-dimensional biomedical features often form communities or modules that can be interconnected with others. While the interconnected community structure has been extensively studied in biomedical research (e.g., gene co-expression networks), its potential to assist in the estimation of covariance matrices remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a procedure that leverages the commonly observed interconnected community structure in high-dimensional biomedical data to estimate large covariance and precision matrices. We derive the uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimators for covariance and precision matrices in closed forms and provide theoretical results on their asymptotic properties. Our proposed method enhances the accuracy of covariance- and precision-matrix estimation and demonstrates superior performance compared to the competing methods in both simulations and real data analyses.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01861","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-02-06T01:52:34Z","registered":"2023-02-06T01:52:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-12-05T03:08:14Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Graphene offers unique opportunities for studying 1/f noise because of its 2D structure and carrier concentration tuneable over a wide range. The creation of practical graphene-based devices will also depend on our ability to understand and control the low-frequency 1/f noise in this material system.

The algorithm assumes the existence of an underlying, invariant kinetic model, a key criterion for reproducible research. Results on both simulated and real-world examples suggest that learning the structure of kinetic systems benefits from a causal perspective. The identified variables and models allow for a concise description of the dynamics across multiple experimental settings and can be used for prediction in unseen experiments.

The simulation is based on a particular reduction of degrees of freedom to commuting matrices of constant fields, and in particular, we can write the wave functions of these degrees of freedom exactly. The square of the wave function is equivalent to a probability density for a Boltzman gas of interacting particles in six dimensions. From the simulation we can extract the density particle distribution for each wave function, and this distribution can be interpreted as a special geometric locus in the gravitational dual. Studying the wave functions associated to half-BPS giant gravitons, we are able to show that the matrix model can measure the Planck scale directly. We also show that the output of our simulation seems to match various theoretical expectations in the large N limit and that it captures 1/N effects as statistical fluctuations of the Boltzman gas with the expected scaling. Our results suggest that this is a very promising approach to explore quantum corrections and effects in gravitational physics on AdS spaces.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"40 pages, 7 figures, uses JHEP. v2: references added","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0702090","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T07:34:34Z","registered":"2022-03-16T07:34:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T22:35:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To avoid the asynchronous pitfall where only vector parts converge to some identical value but scalar parts do not, multiplicative quaternion errors are leveraged to develop attitude synchronization protocols for rigid bodies with the absolute measurements. It is shown that global synchronization of networked rigid bodies can be achieved if and only if the directed topology is quasi-strongly connected. Simultaneously, a novel double-energy-function analysis method, equipped with an ordering permutation technique about scalar parts and a coordinate transformation mechanism, is constructed for the quaternion behavior analysis of networked rigid bodies. In particular, global synchronization is achieved with our analysis method regardless of the highly nonlinear and strongly coupling problems resulting from multiplicative quaternion errors, which seriously hinder the traditional analysis of global synchronization for networked rigid bodies. Simulations for networked spacecraft are presented to show the global synchronization performances under different directed topologies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"26 pages, 6 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16396","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-03-31T01:42:53Z","registered":"2022-03-31T01:42:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-10-10T02:31:21Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However their integration with flying photonic qubits requires an on-chip spin-photon interface, which presents a fundamental problem: the spin-state is measured and controlled via circularly-polarised photons, but waveguides support only linear polarisation. We demonstrate here a solution based on two orthogonal photonic nanowires, in which the spin-state is mapped to a path-encoded photon, thus providing a blue-print for a scalable spin-photon network. Furthermore, for some devices we observe that the circular polarisation state is directly mapped to orthogonal nanowires.

In this paper, we analyze the effect of F-duality on the entropy of a near-extremal $STU$ black hole in $\\mathcal{N}=2$ ungauged, four-dimensional supergravity. We consider double-extremal black holes, whose attractor solutions are fixed in terms of the black hole charges throughout the moduli space. It is well known that JT gravity governs the dynamics of the near-horizon regions of higher dimensional, near-extremal black holes. Owing to this fact, we reduce the four-dimensional supergravity theory to two dimensions to construct a Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity like model and compute the near-extremal entropy. We then analyze the effect of F-duality on this entropy. We show that the F-duality breaks down for the case of near-extremal solutions if one considers the duality operation generated through near-extremal entropy rather than the extremal one.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages; V2: Typos corrected, added some comments and references","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05547","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-20T23:28:13Z","registered":"2022-02-20T23:28:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-22T02:56:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In traditional tracking error-based control approaches, feedback and feedforward controllers are designed based on the nominal model which cannot capture the uncertainties, disturbances and changing working conditions so that they cannot ensure precise path tracking performance in the outdoor environment. In TELC algorithm, the feedforward control actions are updated by using the tracking error dynamics and the plant-model mismatch problem is thus discarded. Therefore, the feedforward controller gradually eliminates the feedback controller from the control of the system once the mobile robot has been on-track. In addition to the proof of the stability, it is proven that the cost functions do not have local minima so that the coefficients in TELC algorithm guarantee that the global minimum is reached. The experimental results show that the TELC algorithm results in better path tracking performance than the traditional tracking error-based control method. The mobile robot controlled by TELC algorithm can track a target path precisely with less than $10$ cm error in off-road terrain.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 13 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11282","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T02:09:26Z","registered":"2022-02-23T02:09:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T02:09:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The data were obtained by profiling the Doppler-broadened absorption of metastable Ar atoms at 763.51 nm in argon and argon/nitrogen plasmas (3, 45, and 90% N2 in Ar) at pressure 0.5-70 Pa and inductive power of 100 and 300 W. The results were compared to rotational temperature derived from the N2 emission at the (0,0) transition of the C - B system. The differences in integrated rotational and Doppler temperatures were attributed to non-uniform spatial distributions of both temperature and thermometric species (Ar* and N2*) that varied depending on conditions. A two-dimensional, two-temperature fluid plasma simulation was employed to explain these differences. This work should facilitate further development of a miniature sensor for non-intrusive acquisition of data (temperature and densities of multiple plasma species) during micro- and nano-fabrication plasma processing, thus enabling the diagnostic-assisted continuous optimization and advanced control over the processes. Such sensors would also enable tracking the origins and pathways of damaging contaminants, thereby providing real-time feedback for adjustment of processes. Our work serves as an example of how two line-of-sight integrated temperatures derived from different thermometric species make it possible to characterize the radial non-uniformity of the plasma.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Presented at the Photonics West conference, Lasers and Applications in Science and Technology, San Jose, CA, January 2004.

Deep learning methods have demonstrated promising coding performance by utilizing rich semantic embeddings optimized for both human and machine vision. However, these compact embeddings struggle to capture fine details such as contours and textures, resulting in imperfect reconstructions. Furthermore, existing learning-based codecs lack scalability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a content-adaptive diffusion model for scalable image compression. The proposed method encodes fine textures through a diffusion process, enhancing perceptual quality while preserving essential features for machine vision tasks. The approach employs a Markov palette diffusion model combined with widely used feature extractors and image generators, enabling efficient data compression. By leveraging collaborative texture-semantic feature extraction and pseudo-label generation, the method accurately captures texture information. A content-adaptive Markov palette diffusion model is then applied to represent both low-level textures and high-level semantic content in a scalable manner. This framework offers flexible control over compression ratios by selecting intermediate diffusion states, eliminating the need for retraining deep learning models at different operating points. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both image reconstruction and downstream machine vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and facial landmark detection, achieving superior perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06149","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-10-10T04:01:43Z","registered":"2024-10-10T04:01:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-10-10T04:01:44Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We consider two distinct minimal models for the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. In a first one, two-flavor vector-like technicolor (VTC) model, we assume that the two-photon fusion is a dominant production mechanism. We include $\u03b3\u03b3\\to {\\tilde \u03c0}^0$ and production of technipion associated with one or two jets. All the considered mechanisms give similar contributions. With the strong Yukawa (technipion-techniquark) coupling $g_{TC}$ = 10 - 20 we obtain the measured cross section of the \"signal\". With such values of $g_{TC}$ we get a relatively small $\u0393_{\\rm tot}$. In a second approach, one-family walking technicolor (WTC) model, the isoscalar technipion is produced dominantly via the gluon-gluon fusion. We also discuss the size of the signal at lower energies (LHC, Tevatron) for $\u03b3\u03b3$ (VTC) and jet-jet (WTC) final states and check consistency with the existing experimental data. We predict a measurable cross section for ${\\tilde \u03c0}^0$ production associated with one or two soft jets. The technipion signal in both models is compared with the SM background diphoton contributions. We observe the dominance of inelastic-inelastic processes for $\u03b3\u03b3$ induced processes. In the VTC scenario, we predict the signal cross section for purely exclusive $p p \\to p p \u03b3\u03b3$ processes at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV to be about 0.2 fb. Such a cross section would be, however, difficult to measure with the planned integrated luminosity.

Although several biochemical pathways have been identified, the underlying mechanical basis including the forces involved in cellular extrusion remain largely unexplored. Utilizing a phase-field model of a three-dimensional cell layer, we study the interplay of cell extrusion with cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions, in a flat monolayer. Independent tuning of cell-cell versus cell-substrate adhesion forces reveals that extrusion events can be distinctly linked to defects in nematic and hexatic orders associated with cellular arrangements. Specifically, we show that by increasing relative cell-cell adhesion forces the cell monolayer can switch between the collective tendency towards five-fold, hexatic, disclinations relative to half-integer, nematic, defects for extruding a cell. We unify our findings by accessing three-dimensional mechanical stress fields to show that an extrusion event acts as a mechanism to relieve localized stress concentration.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07657","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T01:59:13Z","registered":"2022-02-21T01:59:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-04-20T01:04:35Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The second family has a more striking structure, as a non-perturbative gravitational symmetry is obtained from a perturbatively defined symmetry on the YM side. At null infinity, we find the YM origin of the subset of extended Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetries that preserve the self-duality condition. In particular, holomorphic large gauge YM symmetries are double copied to holomorphic supertranslations.

In the zircon-structured oxides we found evidence of a reversible pressure-induced structural phase transformation from zircon to a monazite-type structure. The onset of the transition is near 17-20 GPa. In LaPO4 a non-reversible transition is found around 26 GPa, being a barite-type structure proposed for the high-pressure phase. In the other three monazites, this structure is found to be stable up to highest pressure reached in the experiments. No additional phase transitions or evidences of chemical decomposition are found in the experiments. The equations of state and axial compressibility for the different phases are also determined. In particular, we found that in a given compound the monazite structure is less compressible than zircon structure, being this fact related to the larger packing efficiency of monazite compared with zircon. The differential bond compressibility of different polyhedra is also reported and related the anisotropic compressibility of both structures. Finally, the sequence of structural transitions and compressibilities are discussed in comparison with other orhtophosphates.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"38 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5669","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T14:14:08Z","registered":"2022-03-15T14:14:09Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T14:14:09Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These are strong constraints, and we test directly whether or not matrix elements with these properties can be constructed.

For n&gt;4, we find that R^n, D^2 R^n, D^4 R^n, and D^6 R^n are excluded as counterterms of MHV amplitudes, while only R^n and D^2 R^n are excluded at the NMHV level. As a consequence, for loop order L&lt;7, there are no independent D^{2k}R^n counterterms with n&gt;4. If an operator is not ruled out, our method constructs an explicit superamplitude for its matrix elements. This is done for the 7-loop D^4 R^6 operator at the NMHV level and in other cases.

Indeed, particular charge density wave configurations exhibit the same revivals seen in the PXP model. We generalize the mapping to fillings factors $\u03bd= p/(2p+1)$, and show that the model is equivalent to non-integrable spin-chains within particular constrained Krylov Hilbert spaces. These lead to new examples of quantum many-body scars which manifest as revivals and slow thermalization of particular charge density wave states.

LLMs have shown a high level of creativity in various tasks, but the methods for assessing such creativity are inadequate. The assessment of LLM creativity needs to consider differences from humans, requiring multi-dimensional measurement while balancing accuracy and efficiency. This paper aims to establish an efficient framework for assessing the level of creativity in LLMs. By adapting the modified Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, the research evaluates the creative performance of various LLMs across 7 tasks, emphasizing 4 criteria including Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. In this context, we develop a comprehensive dataset of 700 questions for testing and an LLM-based evaluation method. In addition, this study presents a novel analysis of LLMs' responses to diverse prompts and role-play situations. We found that the creativity of LLMs primarily falls short in originality, while excelling in elaboration. Besides, the use of prompts and the role-play settings of the model significantly influence creativity. Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that collaboration among multiple LLMs can enhance originality. Notably, our findings reveal a consensus between human evaluations and LLMs regarding the personality traits that influence creativity. The findings underscore the significant impact of LLM design on creativity and bridges artificial intelligence and human creativity, offering insights into LLMs' creativity and potential applications.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12491","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-01-24T02:38:14Z","registered":"2024-01-24T02:38:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-02-21T03:09:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

More interestingly, a metal-insulator transition occurs from RuI$_{3}$ bulk to monolayer, and this is mainly due to the band narrowing with the decreasing lattice dimensionality and to the Ru-I hybridization altered by the I $5p$ spin-orbit coupling. In contrast, RuCl$_{3}$ bulk and monolayer both show Mott-insulating behavior, the Ru$^{3+}$ ion is in the formal $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $L=1$ state with a large in-plane orbital moment, and this result well explains the experimental large effective magnetic moment of RuCl$_{3}$ and the strong in-plane magnetization.

However, most works have focused on either acoustic resonator to enhance acoustic wave or optical resonator to enhance optical wave. Herein, we develop a gas sensor based on doubly resonant PAS in which the acoustic and optical waves are simultaneously enhanced using combined optical and acoustic resonators in a centimeter-long configuration. Not only the lower detection limit is enhanced by the double standing waves, but also the upper detection limit is expanded due to the short resonators. As an example, we developed a sensor by detecting acetylene (C2H2), achieving a noise equivalent absorption of 5.7*10-13 cm-1 and a dynamic range of eight orders. Compared to the state-of-the-art PAS gas sensors, the developed sensor increases the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude and extends the dynamic range by three orders of magnitude. Besides, a laser-cavity-molecule locking strategy is proposed to provide additional flexibility of fast gas detection.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08004","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-04-19T02:32:52Z","registered":"2022-04-19T02:32:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-12-09T02:03:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is the only supernova remnant where an observational measurement of the dust destruction efficiency in the reverse shock is possible at present. We determine the pre- and post-shock dust masses in Cas A using a substantially improved dust emission model. In our preferred models, the unshocked ejecta contains $0.6-0.8 \\, {\\rm M}_\\odot$ of $0.1 \\, {\\rm \u03bcm}$ silicate grains, while the post-shock ejecta has $0.02-0.09 \\, {\\rm M}_\\odot$ of $5-10 {\\, {\\rm nm}}$ grains in dense clumps, and $2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, {\\rm M}_\\odot$ of $0.1 \\, {\\rm \u03bcm}$ grains in the diffuse X-ray emitting shocked ejecta.

In particular, we characterize the best recovery operation acting only on the zero-energy Majorana modes and the memory fidelity that can be therewith achieved. In order to understand the effect of such restriction, we discuss two examples of noise models acting on the topological system and compare the amount of information that can be recovered by accessing either the whole system, or the zero-modes only, with particular attention to the scaling with the size of the system and the energy gap. We explicitly discuss the case of a thermal bosonic environment inducing a parity-preserving Markovian dynamics in which the introduced memory fidelity decays exponentially in time, independent from system size, thus showing the impossibility to retrieve the information by acting on the zero-modes only. We argue, however, that even in the presence of experimental limitations, the Hamiltonian gap is still beneficial to the storage of information.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 7 figures.

In some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classified as high risk. To mitigate such disparities, several techniques recently have been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. Here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. We further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. The unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By examining data from Broward County, Florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. We focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"To appear in Proceedings of KDD'17","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08230","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T23:51:10Z","registered":"2022-03-04T23:51:11Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T23:51:11Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This pattern, well developed for high diffraction orders, reflects the main spatial properties of the diffracted beams as well as of the fork grating used for their generation.

However, although conventional convolutions are equivariant to translation, they are not equivariant to other isometries of the input image data, such as rotation and reflection. For the classification of astronomical objects such as radio galaxies, which are expected statistically to be globally orientation invariant, this lack of dihedral equivariance means that a conventional CNN must learn explicitly to classify all rotated versions of a particular type of object individually. In this work we present the first application of group-equivariant convolutional neural networks to radio galaxy classification and explore their potential for reducing intra-class variability by preserving equivariance for the Euclidean group E(2), containing translations, rotations and reflections. For the radio galaxy classification problem considered here, we find that classification performance is modestly improved by the use of both cyclic and dihedral models without additional hyper-parameter tuning, and that a D16 equivariant model provides the best test performance. We use the Monte Carlo Dropout method as a Bayesian approximation to recover epistemic uncertainty as a function of image orientation and show that E(2)-equivariant models are able to reduce variations in model confidence as a function of rotation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 6 figures, accepted MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08252","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T09:14:42Z","registered":"2022-02-23T09:14:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T09:14:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The particular emphasis is the flows whose angular velocity decreases but specific angular momentum increases with increasing radial coordinate. Such flows, however, are Rayleigh stable, but must be turbulent in order to explain astrophysical observed data and, hence, reveal a mismatch between the linear theory and observations/experiments. The mismatch seems to have been resolved, atleast in certain regimes, in the presence of weak magnetic field revealing magnetorotational instability. The present work explores the effects of stochastic noise on such magnetohydrodynamic flows, in order to resolve the above mismatch generically for the hot flows. We essentially concentrate on a small section of such a flow which is nothing but a plane shear flow supplemented by the Coriolis effect, mimicking a small section of an astrophysical accretion disk around a compact object. It is found that such stochastically driven flows exhibit large temporal and spatial auto-correlations and cross-correlations of perturbation and hence large energy dissipations of perturbation, which generate instability. Interestingly, auto-correlations and cross-correlations appear independent of background angular velocity profiles, which are Rayleigh stable, indicating their universality. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to understand the evolution of three-dimensional hydromagnetic perturbations in rotating shear flows in the presence of stochastic noise.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages including 18 figures; accepted for publication in Physical Review E. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1211.5135","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6190","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T04:12:48Z","registered":"2022-03-11T04:12:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T04:12:49Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

There exists experimental data for the equation of state, conductivity, and Thomson scattering spectra. However, the analysis of the measurements at extreme pressures and temperatures typically involves additional model assumptions, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the experimental data. rigorously. On the other hand, theory and modeling have produced extensive collections of data. They originate from a very large variety of models and simulations including path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations, density functional theory (DFT), chemical models, machine-learned models, and combinations thereof. At the same time, each of these methods has fundamental limitations (fermion sign problem in PIMC, approximate exchange-correlation functionals of DFT, inconsistent interaction energy contributions in chemical models, etc.), so for some parameter ranges accurate predictions are difficult. Recently, a number of breakthroughs in first principle PIMC and DFT simulations were achieved which are discussed in this review. Here we use these results to benchmark different simulation methods. We present an update of the hydrogen phase diagram at high pressures, the expected phase transitions, and thermodynamic properties including the equation of state and momentum distribution. Furthermore, we discuss available dynamic results for warm dense hydrogen, including the conductivity, dynamic structure factor, plasmon dispersion, imaginary-time structure, and density response functions. We conclude by outlining strategies to combine different simulations to achieve accurate theoretical predictions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10627","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-05-20T01:21:42Z","registered":"2024-05-20T01:21:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-12-23T03:19:21Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Inspired by the game of Blind Leads, we propose an environment where one agent uses natural language instructions to guide another through a maze. We test the ability of reinforcement learning agents to effectively communicate through discrete word-level symbols and show that the agents are able to sufficiently communicate through natural language with a limited vocabulary. Although the communication is not always perfect English, the agents are still able to navigate the maze. We achieve a BLEU score of 0.85, which is an improvement of 0.61 over randomly generated sequences while maintaining a 100% maze completion rate.

We consider a range of coupling strengths and resonator frequencies to reflect the fact that in practice the system can be tuned to quite a high degree with the resonator formed either by a nanomechanical oscillator or a superconducting stripline fabricated in close proximity to the SSET. For very weak couplings the SSET acts on the resonator like an effective thermal bath. In this regime the current characteristics of the SSET are only weakly modified by the resonator. Using a mean field approach, we show that the current noise is nevertheless very sensitive to the correlations between the resonator and the SSET charge. For stronger couplings, the SSET can drive the resonator into limit cycle states where self-sustained oscillation occurs and we find that regions of well-defined bistability exist. Dynamical transitions into and out of the limit cycle state are marked by strong fluctuations in the resonator energy, but these fluctuations are suppressed within the limit cycle state. We find that the current noise of the SSET is strongly influenced by the fluctuations in the resonator energy and hence should provide a useful indicator of the resonator's dynamics.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Reduced quality figures for arXiv version; v2 minor corrections","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1441","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T21:08:58Z","registered":"2022-03-15T21:08:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T21:08:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Their combination makes visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems more accurate and robust. For globally consistent mapping, however, combining visual and inertial information is not straightforward. To estimate the motion and geometry with a set of images large baselines are required. Because of that, most systems operate on keyframes that have large time intervals between each other. Inertial data on the other hand quickly degrades with the duration of the intervals and after several seconds of integration, it typically contains only little useful information. In this paper, we propose to extract relevant information for visual-inertial mapping from visual-inertial odometry using non-linear factor recovery. We reconstruct a set of non-linear factors that make an optimal approximation of the information on the trajectory accumulated by VIO. To obtain a globally consistent map we combine these factors with loop-closing constraints using bundle adjustment. The VIO factors make the roll and pitch angles of the global map observable, and improve the robustness and the accuracy of the mapping. In experiments on a public benchmark, we demonstrate superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06504","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T13:12:08Z","registered":"2022-02-28T13:12:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T13:12:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this situation it is natural to ask: When is agreement possible? What conditions guarantee that some fraction of the voters agree on even a single platform? Berg et. al. found such conditions when voters are asked to make a decision on a single issue that can be represented on a linear spectrum. In particular, they showed that if two out of every three voters agree on a platform, there is a platform that is acceptable to a majority of the voters. Hardin developed an analogous result when the issue can be represented on a circular spectrum. We examine scenarios in which voters must make two decisions simultaneously. For example, if voters must decide on the day of the week to hold a meeting and the length of the meeting, then the space of possible options forms a cylindrical spectrum. Previous results do not apply to these multi-dimensional voting societies because a voter's preference on one issue often impacts their preference on another. We present a general lower bound on agreement in a two-dimensional voting society, and then examine specific results for societies whose spectra are cylinders and tori.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 8 figures; to appear, Amer.

A search of the spectra in the 100k Data Release results in a census of 55 candidate high-redshift (z &gt; 0.3) quasars. One additional 2dFGRS spectrum of a low-redshift galaxy shows an apparent anomalous broad emission feature perhaps indicating the presence of a gravitationally lensed quasar. These objects have been identified primarily using two automated routines that we have developed specifically for this task, one of which uses a matched filter and the other a wavelet transform. A number of the quasar images possess complicated morphologies, suggesting the presence of either diffuse foreground objects along the line-of-sight or very nearby point sources. The quasar catalogue will form a target list for future absorption and lensing studies, as well as providing an assessment of the loss of quasars with non-stellar images from the companion 2dF QSO Redshift Survey.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Latex 13 pages, 8 figures.

One prominent example of such is the famous Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT), which has furnished both theoretical insights and practical tools. The succinctness of algebraic reasoning would be especially desirable for scalable analysis of quantum programs, given the involvement of exponential-size matrices in most of the existing methods. A few key features of KAT including the idempotent law and the nice properties of classical tests, however, fail to hold in the context of quantum programs due to their unique quantum features, especially in branching. We propose Non-idempotent Kleene Algebra (NKA) as a natural alternative and identify complete and sound semantic models for NKA as well as their quantum interpretations. In light of applications of KAT, we demonstrate algebraic proofs in NKA of quantum compiler optimization and the normal form of quantum while-programs. Moreover, we extend NKA with Tests (i.e., NKAT), where tests model quantum predicates following effect algebra, and illustrate how to encode propositional quantum Hoare logic as NKAT theorems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"extended version, 23 pages, 6 figures, to appear at the 43rd ACM SIGPLAN PLDI 2022","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07018","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T01:27:47Z","registered":"2022-02-21T01:27:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-30T01:59:14Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The density and thermal conditions of these disks can result in rapid accretion onto embedded stars, dramatically altering their evolution in comparison to stars in the interstellar medium. Theoretical models predict that, when subjected to sufficiently rapid accretion, fresh gas replenishes hydrogen in the cores of these stars as quickly as it is burned into helium, reaching a quasi-steady state. Such massive, long-lived (\"immortal\") stars may be capable of dramatically enriching AGN disks with helium, and would increase the helium abundance in AGN broad-line regions relative to that in the corresponding narrow-line regions and hosts. We investigate how the helium abundance of AGN disks alters the evolution of stars embedded therein. We find, in agreement with analytical arguments, that stars at a given mass are more luminous at higher helium mass fractions, and so undergo more radiation-driven mass-loss. We further find that embedded stars tend to be less massive in disks with higher helium mass fractions, and that immortal stars are less common in such disks. Thus, disk composition can alter the rates of electromagnetic and gravitational wave transients as well as further chemical enrichment by embedded stars.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 6 figures.

In particular, micro-controllers consume far too much power. In order to overcome this problem, new circuit designs have been proposed and the use of spiking neurons and analog computing has emerged as it allows a very significant consumption reduction. However, working in the analog domain brings difficulty to handle the sequential processing of incoming signals as is needed in many use cases. In this paper, we use a bio-inspired phenomenon called Interacting Synapses to produce a time filter, without using non-biological techniques such as synaptic delays. We propose a model of neuron and synapses that fire for a specific range of delays between two incoming spikes, but do not react when this Inter-Spike Timing is not in that range. We study the parameters of the model to understand how to choose them and adapt the Inter-Spike Timing. The originality of the paper is to propose a new way, in the analog domain, to deal with temporal sequences.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10411","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-11-20T02:08:33Z","registered":"2023-11-20T02:08:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-11-20T02:08:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

EEL spectra of GaS shift towards high energy region (red shift) with group II elements doping while no significant shift is observed for group IVa elements doping in both the polarizations. We found quantum conductance of 4G0 for doped GaS monolayer except for Be-doped GaS. The metallic character of doped GaS is clearly captured in tunneling current characteristics showing ohmic-like characteristics for doped GaS monolayer. This is due to finite density of states associated with S atoms of doped GaS.

The cause of this low radio detection rate has previously been attributed to limited observing sensitivity. We use visibility stacking to test this idea, and conclude that the low detection rate is instead due to two intrinsically different populations of GRBs, radio bright and radio faint. We calculate that no more than 70% of GRB afterglows are truly radio bright, leaving a significant population of GRBs that lack a radio afterglow. These radio bright GRBs have higher gamma-ray fluence, isotropic energies, X-ray fluxes and optical fluxes than the radio faint GRBs, confirming the existence of two physically distinct populations. We suggest that the gamma-ray efficiency of the prompt emission is responsible for the difference between the two populations.

Imaging the cold interstellar medium can provide a unique view of the kinematics associated with the assembly of galaxies. In this paper, we analyzed the spatial distribution and kinematics of the cold ionized gas of the normal star-forming galaxy COS-2987030247 at z = 6.8076, based on new high-resolution observations of the [C II] 158um line emission obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These observations allowed us to compare the spatial distribution and extension of the [C II] and rest-frame UV emission, model the [C II] line data-cube using 3DBarolo, and measure the [C II] luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities in the galaxy subregions. The system is found to be composed of a main central source, a fainter north extension, and candidate [C II] companions located 10-kpc away. We find similar rest-frame UV and [C II] spatial distributions, suggesting that the [C II] emission emerges from the star-forming regions. The agreement between the UV and [C II] surface brightness radial profiles rules out diffuse, extended [C II] emission in the main galaxy component. The [C II] velocity map reveals a velocity gradient in the north-south direction suggesting ordered motion, as commonly found in rotating-disk galaxies. But higher-resolution observations would be needed to rule out a compact merger scenario. Our model indicates a low average velocity dispersion, $\u03c3$ &lt; 30 km s$^{-1}$. This result implies a dispersion lower than the expected value from observations and semi-analytic models of high redshift galaxies. We argue that COS-2987030247 is a candidate rotating disk experiencing a short period of stability which will be possibly perturbed at later times by accreting sources.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages (+ 8 Appendix), 15 Figures, Accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13770","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-06-29T01:04:01Z","registered":"2022-06-29T01:04:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-01-05T01:55:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It was shown that plasma in the energy range 0.1-10 MeV first reaches kinetic equilibrium, on a timescale t_{k}&lt;10^{-14} sec, with detailed balance between binary interactions such as Compton, Bhabha and Moller scattering, and pair production and annihilation. Later the electron-positron-photon plasma approaches thermal equilibrium on a timescale t_{th}&lt;10^{-12} sec, with detailed balance for all direct and inverse reactions. In the present paper we systematically present details of the computational scheme used in [1], as well as generalize our treatment, considering proton loading of the pair plasma. When proton loading is large, protons thermalize first by proton-proton scattering, and then with the electron-positron-photon plasma by proton-electron scattering. In the opposite case of small proton loading proton-electron scattering dominates over proton-proton one. Thus in all cases the plasma, even with proton admixture, reaches thermal equilibrium configuration on a timescale t_{th}&lt;10^{-11} sec.

However, it has some significant limitations that prevent it from achieving full efficiency. First, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target distribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to clarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional problems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due to parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic distribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical predictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric constraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization framework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target distribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from the generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution optimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed framework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the framework is validated through aerodynamic shape optimizations of the wind turbine airfoil. Their results show that this framework is accurate, efficient, and flexible to be applied to other inverse design engineering applications.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08500","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-22T01:56:30Z","registered":"2022-02-22T01:56:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T02:39:55Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The pathway of WDs acquiring mass may produce circumstellar material (CSM). Observing SNe Ia within a few hours to a few days after the explosion can provide insight into the nature of CSM relating to the progenitor systems. In this paper, we propose a CSM model to investigate the effect of ejecta-CSM interaction on the early-time multi-band light curves of SNe Ia. By varying the mass-loss history of the progenitor system, we apply the ejecta-CSM interaction model to fit the optical and ultraviolet (UV) photometric data of eight SNe Ia with early excess. The photometric data of SNe Ia in our sample can be well-matched by our CSM model except for the UV-band light curve of iPTF14atg, indicating its early excess may not be due to the ejecta-CSM interaction. Meanwhile, the CSM interaction can generate synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the shocked gas, making radio observations a distinctive probe of CSM. The radio luminosity based on our models suggests that positive detection of the radio signal is only possible within a few days after the explosion at higher radio frequencies (e.g., ~250 GHz); at lower frequencies (e.g., ~1.5 GHz) the detection is difficult. These models lead us to conclude that a multi-messenger approach that involves UV, optical, and radio observations of SNe Ia a few days past explosion is needed to address many of the outstanding questions concerning the progenitor systems of SNe Ia.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Published to MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02186","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-07-06T02:08:46Z","registered":"2023-07-06T02:08:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-08-15T02:20:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The quantum Hall phase is realized in terms of free fermions with nonrelativistic dispersion relation, possessing a global $U(1)$ symmetry. We couple this symmetry with a background gauge field and compute the effective action by integrating out the gapped fermions. In spite of the fact that the corresponding Dirac operator governing the dynamics of the original fermions is nonrelativistic, the leading contribution in the effective action is a usual Abelian $U(1)$ Chern-Simons term. The proximity to a conventional superconductor induces a pairing potential in the quantum Hall state, favoring the formation of Cooper pairs. When the pairing is strong enough, it drives the system to a topological superconducting phase, hosting Majorana fermions. Even though the continuum $U(1)$ symmetry is broken down to a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ one, we can forge fictitious $U(1)$ symmetries that enable us to derive the effective action for the topological superconducting phase, also given by a Chern-Simons theory. To eliminate spurious states coming from the artificial symmetry enlargement, we demand that the fields in the effective action are $O(2)$ instead of $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the $O(2)$ case we have to sum over the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ bundles in the partition function, which projects out the states that are not $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants.

Specifically, the S-wave scattering phase shifts of two-baryon systems at low energies are obtained with the application of L\u00fcscher's formalism, mapping the energy eigenvalues of two interacting baryons in a finite volume to the two-particle scattering amplitudes below the relevant inelastic thresholds. The values of the leading-order low-energy scattering parameters in the irreducible representations of SU(3) are consistent with an approximate SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry in the nuclear and hypernuclear forces that is predicted in the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD. The two distinct SU(6)-invariant interactions between two baryons are constrained at this value of the quark masses, and their values indicate an approximate accidental SU(16) symmetry.

If the gamma rays are produced mainly by hadronic processes rather than leptonic processes like bremsstrahlung, then the flux of energetic cosmic ray (CR) nuclei (&gt;1 GeV) required to produce the gamma rays can be inferred at the site where the particles are accelerated in SNR shocks. It is of great interest to understand the acceleration of the CR of lower energy (&lt;1 GeV) accompanying the energetic component. These particles of lower energy are most effective in ionizing interstellar gas, leaving an observable imprint on the interstellar ion chemistry. A correlation of energetic gamma radiation with enhanced interstellar ionization can thus support the hadronic origin of the gamma rays and constrain the acceleration of ionizing CR in SNR. We propose a method to test the hadronic origin of GeV gamma rays from SNR associated with a molecular cloud. We use observational gamma ray data for each of these SNR known, modeling the observations to obtain the underlying proton spectrum assuming that the gamma rays are produced by pion decay. Assuming that the acceleration mechanism does not only produce high energy protons, but also low energy protons, this proton spectrum at the source is then used to calculate the ionization rate of the molecular cloud. Ionized molecular hydrogen triggers a chemical network forming molecular ions. The relaxation of these ions results in characteristic line emission, which can be predicted. We show that the ionization rate for at least two objects is more than an order of magnitude above Galactic average for molecular clouds, hinting at an enhanced formation rate of molecular ions. There will be interesting opportunities to measure crucial molecular ions in the infrared and submillimeter-wave parts of the spectrum.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"published in Astronomy and Astrophysics, 13 pages, 19 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4674","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T23:37:04Z","registered":"2022-03-12T23:37:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T23:37:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Some of these have not previously been observed via near-equilibrium compression of silicon. In this study, confocal Raman micro-spectroscopy and Raman imaging of arrays of microexplosions have been conducted to search for Raman signatures of these novel allotropes of silicon. A microexplosion is generated at the interface between a thick silicon dioxide confinement layer and underlying silicon. It is characterised by a void at the interface above a region of compressed silicon. Raman data show a rich assembly of silicon phases within the modified silicon. Residual stresses up to 4.5 GPa in the modifications have been determined from the shift in the main diamond-cubic Si Raman peak. The computed Raman spectra for a number of Si allotropes show reasonable agreement with the experimental spectra. Two structurally similar tetragonal phases of silicon (the rhombohedral r8 and the body-centred bc8) phases as well as recently identified bt8-Si are all highly likely to be contained in Raman spectra from many laser-modified sites. Although the st12-Si phase, previously observed in our electron diffraction studies of the highly compressively stressed laser-modified regions, was not reliably identified from Raman data, we suggest this could be due to the possible difference in residual stress level in the sites analysed by the electron diffraction and Raman spectra. Several other unidentified Raman peaks were observed, suggesting the presence of other unknown silicon phases. All of these silicon phases are expected to have attractive semiconducting properties including narrow band gap that open up novel applications.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 6 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14039","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T00:24:19Z","registered":"2022-02-26T00:24:20Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T00:24:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our analysis implies that in order to have infinitely many higher spin states, one needs to consider infinitely many Regge trajectories with an increasing folding number.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages, 16 figures: version published in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09746","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T09:34:54Z","registered":"2022-02-23T09:34:55Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-09-14T01:20:17Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This method results in confusion over the invulnerability of various types of complex networks. By normalizing network efficiency and defining a baseline, this paper defines the invulnerability index as the integral of the difference between the normalized network efficiency curve and the baseline. This quantitative method seeks to establish a benchmark for the robustness and fragility of networks and to measure network invulnerability under both edge and node attacks. To validate the reliability of the proposed method, three small-world networks were selected as test beds. The simulation results indicate that the proposed invulnerability index can effectively and accurately quantify network resilience. The index should provide a valuable reference for determining network invulnerability in future research.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1357","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T23:35:27Z","registered":"2022-03-11T23:35:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T23:35:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties which seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this paper, we highlight another property which is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly-knit groups between which there are only looser connections. We propose a new method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known, and find that it detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well-known - a collaboration network and a food web - and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0112110","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T05:52:40Z","registered":"2022-03-19T05:52:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T05:52:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We introduce a statistic which generalizes the excess power statistic proposed by Flanagan and Hughes and extended by Anderson et al. The statistic we propose is shown to be optimal for arbitrary noise spectral characteristic, under the two hypotheses that the noise is Gaussian, and that the prior for the signal is uniform. The statistic derivation is based on the assumption that a signal affects only affects N samples in the data stream, but that no other information is a priori available, and that the value of the signal at each sample can be arbitrary. We show that the proposed statistic can be implemented combining standard time-series analysis tools which can be efficiently implemented, and the resulting computational cost is still compatible with an on-line analysis of interferometric data. We generalize this version of an excess power statistic to the multiple detector case, also including the effect of correlated noise. We give full details about the implementation of the algorithm, both for the single and the multiple detector case, and we discuss exact and approximate forms, depending on the specific characteristics of the noise and on the assumed length of the burst event. As a example, we show what would be the sensitivity of the network of interferometers to a delta-function burst.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"21 pages, 5 figures in 3 groups.

And graph transformers address these issues through self-attention, yet face scalability and noise challenges on large-scale graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose GNNMoE, a universal model architecture for node classification. This architecture flexibly combines fine-grained message-passing operations with a mixture-of-experts mechanism to build feature encoding blocks. Furthermore, by incorporating soft and hard gating layers to assign the most suitable expert networks to each node, we enhance the model's expressive power and adaptability to different graph types. In addition, we introduce adaptive residual connections and an enhanced FFN module into GNNMoE, further improving the expressiveness of node representation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GNNMoE performs exceptionally well across various types of graph data, effectively alleviating the over-smoothing issue and global noise, enhancing model robustness and adaptability, while also ensuring computational efficiency on large-scale graphs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted by ACM Web Conference 2025 as a short paper","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08193","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-12-12T02:52:25Z","registered":"2024-12-12T02:52:26Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-02-13T03:14:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Although the neutrino spectrum emitted by $^8$B $\u03b2$-decay reactions in the Sun's core is identical to the neutrino spectrum measured in the laboratory, due to vacuum and matter flavor oscillations, this spectrum will be very different from that measured on Earth by the different solar neutrino experiments. We study how the presence of dark matter (DM) in the Sun's core changes the shape of the $^8$B electron-neutrino spectrum. These modifications are caused by local variations of the electronic density and the $^8$B neutrino source, induced by local changes of the temperature, density and chemical composition. Particularly relevant are the shape changes at low and medium energy range $(E_\u03bd\\le 10 {\\; \\rm MeV})$, for which the experimental noise level is expected to be quite small. If such a distortion in the $^8$B$\u03bd_e$ spectrum were to be observed, this would strongly hint in favor of the existence of DM in the Sun's core. The $^8$B electron-neutrino spectrum provides a complementary method to helioseismology and total neutrino fluxes for constraining the DM properties. In particular, we study the impact of light asymmetric DM on solar neutrino spectra. Accurate neutrino spectra measurements could help to determine whether light asymmetric DM exists in the Sun's core, since it has been recently advocated that this type of DM might resolve the solar abundance problem.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 5 figures.

Here we show that any element in the unitary group U(n) can be executed in no more than three steps, for any n. This enables the implementation of highly complex operations in constant time, and in some cases even allows for the compilation of an entire algorithm down to only three operations. Using this protocol we show how to prepare any pure state of an SES chip in three steps, and also how to compute, for a given SES state rho, the expectation value of any nxn Hermitian observable O in a constant number of steps.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04621","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T05:49:04Z","registered":"2022-03-07T05:49:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T05:49:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A typical attack performs intentional cache access and manipulates cache states to leak secrets by observing the victim's cache access patterns. Different countermeasures have been proposed to defend against both general and transient execution based attacks. Despite their effectiveness, they mostly trade some level of performance for security, or have restricted security scope. In this paper, we seek an approach to enforcing security while maintaining performance. We leverage the insight that attackers need to access cache in order to manipulate and observe cache state changes for information leakage. Specifically, we propose Prefender, a secure prefetcher that learns and predicts attack-related accesses for prefetching the cachelines to simultaneously help security and performance. Our results show that Prefender is effective against several cache side channel attacks while maintaining or even improving performance for SPEC CPU 2006 and 2017 benchmarks.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitting to a journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06756","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-07-14T01:04:05Z","registered":"2023-07-14T01:04:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-05-17T01:18:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The two dominant models are that the turbulence is driven by star formation feedback and/or that it is produced by gravitational instability in the gas. Here we show that, while both models predict that the galaxies' ISM velocity dispersions will be positively correlated with their star formation rates, the forms of the correlation predicted by these two models are subtly but measurably different. A feedback-driven origin for the turbulence predicts a velocity dispersion that rises more sharply with star formation rate, and that does not depend on the gas fraction (i.e. $\\dot{M}_* \\propto \u03c3^2$), while a gravity-driven model yields a shallower rise and a strong dependence on gas fraction (i.e. $\\dot{M}_* \\propto f_g^2 \u03c3$). We compare the models to a collection of data on local and high-redshift galaxies culled from the literature, and show that the correlation expected for gravity-driven turbulence is a better match to the observations than a feedback-driven model. This suggests that gravity is the ultimate source of ISM turbulence, at least in the rapidly-star-forming, high velocity dispersion galaxies for which our test is most effective. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the present data set, and the prospects for future measurements to enable a more definitive test of the two models.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 3 figures, MNRAS in press; minor text edits from previous version, no substantive changes","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03439","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T23:26:01Z","registered":"2022-03-06T23:26:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T23:26:02Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The MCE in Gd shows inconsiderable changes with field frequency. Near paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition in Ni43Mn37.9In12.1Co7 Heusler alloy a slight reduction of MCE with frequency is observed. In weak alternating fields in materials with AFM-FM magneto-structural phase transitions (Fe48Rh52, Ni43Mn37.9In12.1Co7) it is not possible to get a structural contribution to overall MCE because of irreversibility of the transitions in these fields. Near magneto-structural phase transitions the MCE in these alloys has only magnetic contribution, and does not show a significant dependence on the magnetic field frequency. In Ni2.07Co0.09Mn0.84Ga Heusler alloy the MCE vanishes at frequencies about 20 Hz. The obtained results show the increase of frequencies of operating cycles is one of the powerful methods to improve the efficiency of magnetic refrigerators in case of Gd as a refrigerant.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10391","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T22:37:42Z","registered":"2022-03-02T22:37:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T22:37:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We place our results into context by self-consistently comparing to samples of nearby star-forming galaxies, luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), and quasars. With the exception of two sources, we find no significant evolution in the dust emissivity index across cosmic time, measuring a consistent value of $\u03b2_\\text{IR} = 1.8 \\pm 0.3$ at $z &gt; 4$, suggesting the effective dust properties do not change dramatically for most galaxies. Despite having comparable stellar masses, we find the high-redshift galaxies to be similar to, or even more extreme than, LIRGs in the HERUS sample in terms of dust temperature ($T_\\text{dust} &gt; 40 \\, \\mathrm{K}$) and IR luminosity ($L_\\text{IR} &gt; 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{L_\\odot}$). We find the dust temperature evolves mildly towards high redshift, though the LIRGs and quasars exhibit elevated temperatures indicating a more efficient and/or additional heating mechanism. Where available, we compare stellar-mass estimates to our inferred dust masses, whose degeneracy with dust temperature can only be mitigated with a well-constrained SED. In merely half of the cases the dust yield may be explained by supernovae alone, with four sources ($44\\%$) significantly exceeding a highly optimistic yield where $M_\\text{dust} \\approx 0.01 M_*$. We discuss possible explanations for this apparent inconsistency and potential observational biases in the measurements of the dust properties of high-redshift galaxies, including in the current IR-bright sample.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 8 figures.

We have obtained redshifts for three lens systems, SBS 0909+532, HST 1411+5211, and CLASS B2319+051. For all of these systems, either the source or lens redshift (or both) has been previously unidentified. We find (z_l, z_s) = (0.830, 1.377) for SBS 0909+532; (z_l, z_s) = (0.465, 2.811) for HST 1411+5211, although the source redshift is still tentative; and (z_l1, z_l2) = (0.624, 0.588) for the two lensing galaxies in CLASS B2319+051. The background radio source in B2319+051 has not been detected optically; its redshift is, therefore, still unknown. We find that the spectral features of the central lensing galaxy in all three systems are typical of an early-type galaxy. The observed image splittings in SBS 0909+532 and HST 1411+5211 imply that the masses within the Einstein ring radii of the lensing galaxies are 1.4 x 10^{11} and 2.0 x 10^{11} h^{-1} M_sun, respectively. The resulting B band mass-to-light ratio for HST 1411+5211 is 41.3 +/- 1.2 h (M/L)_sun, a factor of 5 times higher than the average early-type lensing galaxy. This large mass-to-light is almost certainly the result of the additional mass contribution from the cluster CL 3C295 at z = 0.46. For the lensing galaxy in SBS 0909+532, we measure (M/L)_B = 4^{+11}_{-3} h (M/L)_sun where the large errors are the result of significant uncertainty in the galaxy luminosity. While we cannot measure directly the mass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxy in B2319+051, we estimate that (M/L)_B is between 3-7 h (M/L)_sun.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in Astronomical Journal. 21 pages, including 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9910523","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T21:22:59Z","registered":"2022-03-20T21:23:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T21:23:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Compared to the traditional hybrid approach of MPI plus OpenMP, a new, but promising hybrid approach of MPI plus MPI-3 shared-memory extensions (MPI+MPI) is gaining attraction. We describe an algorithmic approach for collective operations (with allgather and broadcast as concrete examples) in the context of hybrid MPI+MPI, so as to minimize memory consumption and memory copies. With this approach, only one memory copy is maintained and shared by on-node processes. This allows the removal of unnecessary on-node copies of replicated data that are required between MPI processes when the collectives are invoked in the context of pure MPI. We compare our approach of collectives for hybrid MPI+MPI and the traditional one for pure MPI, and also have a discussion on the synchronization that is required to guarantee data integrity. The performance of our approach has been validated on a Cray XC40 system (Cray MPI) and NEC cluster (OpenMPI), showing that it achieves comparable or better performance for allgather operations. We have further validated our approach with a standard computational kernel, namely distributed matrix multiplication, and a Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization code.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages.

Answer-Set Programming (ASP) has shown great potential in this regard to add interpretability and explainability to modular VQA architectures. In this work, we address the problem of how to integrate ASP with modules for vision and natural language processing to solve a new and demanding VQA variant that is concerned with images of graphs (not graphs in symbolic form). Images containing graph-based structures are an ubiquitous and popular form of visualisation. Here, we deal with the particular problem of graphs inspired by transit networks, and we introduce a novel dataset that amends an existing one by adding images of graphs that resemble metro lines. Our modular neuro-symbolic approach combines optical graph recognition for graph parsing, a pretrained optical character recognition neural network for parsing labels, Large Language Models (LLMs) for language processing, and ASP for reasoning. This method serves as a first baseline and achieves an overall average accuracy of 73% on the dataset.

Traditional dense optical flow methods compute the pixel displacement between two images. Due to missing information, these approaches cannot recover the pixel trajectories in the blind time between two images. In this work, we show that it is possible to compute per-pixel, continuous-time optical flow using events from an event camera. Events provide temporally fine-grained information about movement in pixel space due to their asynchronous nature and microsecond response time. We leverage these benefits to predict pixel trajectories densely in continuous time via parameterized B\u00e9zier curves. To achieve this, we build a neural network with strong inductive biases for this task: First, we build multiple sequential correlation volumes in time using event data. Second, we use B\u00e9zier curves to index these correlation volumes at multiple timestamps along the trajectory. Third, we use the retrieved correlation to update the B\u00e9zier curve representations iteratively. Our method can optionally include image pairs to boost performance further. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first method that can regress dense pixel trajectories from event data. To train and evaluate our model, we introduce a synthetic dataset (MultiFlow) that features moving objects and ground truth trajectories for every pixel. Our quantitative experiments not only suggest that our method successfully predicts pixel trajectories in continuous time but also that it is competitive in the traditional two-view pixel displacement metric on MultiFlow and DSEC-Flow.

This leads to Arrhenius diffusion kinetics at low T and diffusivity proportional to temperature at high T.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0401525","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T14:47:16Z","registered":"2022-03-18T14:47:17Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T14:47:17Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is based on the idea of separation of the spectra of electrons or positrons produced in captures of relic neutrinos on unstable nuclei from those from the usual $\u03b2$-decay and requires very high energy resolution of the detector, comparable to the neutrino mass. In this paper we suggest an alternative method of discrimination between neutrino capture and $\u03b2$-decay, based on periodic variations of angular correlations in inverse beta decay transitions induced by relic neutrino capture. The time variations are expected to arise due to the peculiar motion of the Sun with respect to the C$\u03bd$B rest frame and the rotation of the Earth about its axis and can be observed in experiments with both polarized and unpolarized nuclear targets. The main advantage of the suggested method is that it does not depend crucially on the energy resolution of detection of the produced $\u03b2$-particles and can be operative even if this resolution exceeds the largest neutrino mass.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"24 pages, 1 figure. v2: title changed, section 4 modified, Appendix B added, references added. v3: section 4 slightly expanded; eq.

We measure V_2.2 from long-slit H-alpha rotation curves and infer M_* from galaxy i-band luminosities (L_i) and g-r colors. We find logarithmic slopes of 2.60+/-0.13 and 3.05+/-0.12 for the L_i-V_2.2 and M_*-V_2.2 relations, somewhat shallower than most previous studies, with intrinsic scatter of 0.13 dex and 0.16 dex. Our direct estimates of the total-to-stellar mass ratio within 2.2R_d, assuming a Kroupa IMF, yield a median ratio of 2.4 for M_*&gt;10^10 Msun and 4.4 for M_*=10^9-10^10 Msun, with large scatter at a given M_* and R_d. The typical ratio of the rotation speed predicted for the stellar disk alone to the observed rotation speed at 2.2R_d is ~0.65. The distribution of R_d at fixed M_* is broad, but we find no correlation between disk size and the residual from the M_*-V_2.2 relation, implying that this relation is an approximately edge-on view of the disk galaxy fundamental plane. Independent of the assumed IMF, this result implies that stellar disks do not, on average, dominate the mass within 2.2R_d. We discuss our results in the context of infall models of disk formation in cold dark matter halos. A model with a disk-to-halo mass ratio m_d=0.05 provides a reasonable match to the R_d-M_* distribution for spin parameters \u03bbranging from ~0.04-0.08, and it yields a reasonable match to the mean M_*-V_2.2 relation. A model with m_d=0.1 predicts overly strong correlations between disk size and M_*-V_2.2 residual. Explaining the wide range of halo-to-disk mass ratios within 2.2R_d requires significant scatter in m_d values, with systematically lower m_d for galaxies with lower $M_*$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 2 tables, 7 figures, Accepted to ApJ, Table 1 updated, otherwise minor changes","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504581","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T23:15:48Z","registered":"2022-03-17T23:15:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T23:15:49Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

By varying the detuning, amplitudes, and phase difference of lasers applied to a nitrogen-vacancy center, one can directly realize an arbitrary single-qubit holonomic gate on the spin. Meanwhile, with the help of cavity-assisted interactions, a nontrivial two-qubit holonomic quantum gate can also be induced. The distinct merit of this scheme is that all the quantum gates are obtained via an all-optical geometric manipulation of the solid-state spins. Therefore, our scheme opens the possibility for robust quantum computation using solid-state spins in an all-optical way.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"To be published at Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08852","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T01:35:26Z","registered":"2022-03-05T01:35:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T01:35:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Accordingly, mere fittings of observed data by the q-exponential distributions do not lead to identification of the correct physical entropy. Here, stabilities of these entropies, i.e., their behaviors under arbitrary small deformation of a distribution, are examined.

Additionally, we develop comprehensive dynamics and control systems for both air and wheel mode, based on the bi-copter model and the two-wheel self-balancing robot model.

We exploit the fact that at such low energies, the large mixing angle solution to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein matter effects in the sun are small for 7^Be and pep and negligible for pp. Consequently, the neutrinos produced in the sun change their flavor almost entirely through vacuum oscillations during propagation from the sun's surface and through possible nonstandard interactions acting at the solar source and Borexino detector. We combine the different NSI effects at source and detector in a single framework and use the current Borexino data to bound NSI non-universal and flavor- changing parameters at energies below the reach of reactor neutrino experiments. We also study the implication of the current data for the weak- mixing angle at this \"low-energy frontier\" data from the Borexino experiment, where it is expected to be slightly larger than its value at the Z mass. We find $\\sin^2(\u03b8)w=0.224+-0.016$, the lowest energy-scale estimate to date.

One of the models is reconstructed from parametrization of effective or total equation of state of energy components in the universe ($w_{eff}$ model) and the other model is the constant dark energy equation of state model, namely the $w$CDM model. The linear and nonlinear evolution of matter density contrast are studied for the present models. It is observed that the linear and even the nonlinear evolutions of density contract are almost indistinguishable in these two models. The critical density contrast at collapse as a function of redshift is also studied. The nature of critical density contrast is also found to be degenerate in the present models. Further the number count of collapsed objects or dark matter halos along redshift are also studied. Two different halo mass functions, namely the Press-Schechter mass function and the Sheth-Tormen mass function, are adopted in this context. It is observed that for both the mass functions the $w_{eff}$ model has slightly higher number of halos at very low redshift ($z&lt;0.5$) and at higher redshift the $w$CDM model has higher number of dark matter halos. On the other hand, it is observed that the Press-Schechter mass function produces slightly higher number of dark matter halos at low redshift compared to Sheth-Torman mass function and the number of halos is higher for Sheth-Torman mass function at redshift $z&gt;0.9$ for both the dark energy models. The results clearly show that these two highly degenerate dark energy models are distinguishable in the study of spherical collapse and galaxy cluster number counts.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 9 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03792","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-25T06:05:52Z","registered":"2022-02-25T06:05:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-03-18T04:09:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here, we use Monte Carlo simulations to study cosmic ray sampling of a simple, two-phase ISM under conditions similar to those of the prototypical starburst galaxy M82. The assumption that cosmic rays sample the mean density of the ISM in the starburst region is assessed over a multi-dimensional parameter space where we vary the number of molecular clouds, the galactic wind speed, the extent to which the magnetic field is tangled, and the cosmic ray injection mechanism. We evaluate the ratio of the emissivity from pion production in molecular clouds to the emissivity that would be observed if the cosmic rays sampled the mean density, and seek areas of parameter space where this ratio differs significantly from unity. The assumption that cosmic rays sample the mean density holds over much of parameter space; however, this assumption begins to break down for high cloud density, injection close to the clouds, and a very tangled magnetic field. We conclude by evaluating the extent to which our simulated starburst region behaves as a proton calorimeter and constructing the time-dependent spectrum of a burst of cosmic rays.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0006","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T14:14:49Z","registered":"2022-03-10T14:14:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T14:14:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For this purpose, YSO candidate catalogs are compiled from various surveys, especially in the infrared (IR), and simple selection schemes in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are often used to identify and classify YSOs. We propose a methodology for YSO classification through Machine Learning (ML) using Spitzer IR data. We detail our approach in order to ensure reproducibility and provide an in-depth example on how to efficiently apply ML to an astrophysical classification. We used feedforward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that use the four IRAC bands ($3.6, 4.5, 5.8$ and $8 \u03bcm$) and the $24\\ \u03bcm$ MIPS band from Spitzer to classify point source objects into CI and CII YSO candidates or as contaminants. We found that ANNs can efficiently be applied to YSO classification with a contained number of neurons ($\\sim$ 25). Knowledge gathered on one star-forming region has shown to be partly efficient for prediction in new regions. Best generalization capacity was achieved using a combination of several star-forming regions to train the network. Carefully rebalancing the training proportions was necessary to achieve good results. We achieved above 90% and 97% recovery rate for CI and CII YSOs, respectively, with precision above 80% and 90% for our most general result. We took advantage of the ANN great flexibility to define, for each object, an effective membership probability to each output class. Using a threshold in this probability was found to efficiently improve the classification results at a reasonable cost of object exclusion. With this selection, we reached 90% precision on CI YSOs, for more than half of them. Our catalog of YSO candidates in Orion (365 CI, 2381 CII) and NGC 2264 (101 CI, 469 CII) predicted by our final ANN is publicly available at CDS.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01601","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T10:45:28Z","registered":"2022-02-24T10:45:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T10:45:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

One of the prime challenges in mining medical datasets is handling missing values which is part of preprocessing phase.

The proposed platform opens the way to the investigation of EPs for enhanced light-matter interactions and applications in communication, sensing and imaging.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02276","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T18:54:00Z","registered":"2022-03-05T18:54:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T18:54:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The bridge functions, which are neglected in the hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximation, are taken into account through the density expansion for the Helmholtz free energy functional up to the third order. A factorization approximation to the ternary direct correlation functions in terms of the site-site pair correlation functions is then employed in the expression of the bridge functions, thus leading to a closed set of integral equations for the determination of the RDFs. It is confirmed through numerical calculations that incorporation of the oxygen-oxygen bridge function substantially improves the poor descriptions by the HNC approximation at room temperature, e.g., for the second peak of the oxygen-oxygen RDF.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"2 figures, Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences (2014)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5929","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-03-10T06:16:37Z","registered":"2022-03-10T06:16:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-10-13T01:13:24Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This study is performed by exploiting the multi-wavelength, from UV to sub-mm bands, DustPedia database, in addition to molecular (12CO) and atomic (HI) gas maps and metallicity abundance information available in the literature. We fitted the surface brightness profiles of the tracers of dust and stars, the mass surface density profiles of dust, stars, molecular gas, and total gas, and the SFR surface density profiles with an exponential curve and derived their scale-lengths. We also developed a method to solve for the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (alpha_CO) per galaxy by using dust and gas mass profiles. Although each galaxy has its own peculiar behaviour, we identified a common trend of the exponential scale-lengths vs. wavelength. On average, the scale-lengths normalized to the B-band 25 mag/arcsec^2 radius decrease from UV to 70 micron, from 0.4 to 0.2, and then increase back up to 0.3 at 500 microns. The main result is that, on average, the dust mass surface density scale-length is about 1.8 times the stellar one derived from IRAC data and the 3.6 micron surface brightness, and close to that in the UV. We found a mild dependence of the scale-lengths on the Hubble stage T: the scale-lengths of the Herschel bands and the 3.6 micron scale-length tend to increase from earlier to later types, the scale-length at 70 micron tends to be smaller than that at longer sub-mm wavelength with ratios between longer sub-mm wavelengths and 70 micron that decrease with increasing T. The scale-length ratio of SFR and stars shows a weak increasing trend towards later types.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"33 pages, 9 figures (at low resolution here), 8 tables, Accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05351","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T00:03:40Z","registered":"2022-03-04T00:03:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T00:03:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here, I review the case of gamma rays which are particularly promising in this respect: distinct and unambiguous spectral signatures would not only allow a clear discrimination from astrophysical backgrounds but also to extract important properties of the dark matter particles; powerful observational facilities like the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope or upcoming large, ground-based Cherenkov telescope arrays will be able to probe a considerable part of the underlying, e.g. supersymmetric, parameter space. I conclude with a more detailed comparison of indirect and direct dark matter searches, showing that these two approaches are, indeed, complementary.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 4 figures, World Science proceedings style.

We approximate the stream as a series of discrete massive particles ejected in the ballistic limit at the inner Lagrangian point of the donor toward the accretor. This work improves upon similar earlier studies in a number of ways. First, we self-consistently calculate the total angular momentum of the orbit at all times. This includes changes in the orbital angular momentum during the ballistic trajectory of the ejected mass, as well as changes during the ejection/accretion due to the radial component of the particle's velocity. Second, we calculate the particle's ballistic trajectory for each system, which allows us to determine the precise position and velocity of the particle upon accretion. We can then include specific information about the radius of the accretor as well as the angle of impact. Finally, we ensure that the total angular momentum is conserved, which requires the donor star spin to vary self-consistently. We calculate the angular momentum change of the orbit and each binary component across the entire parameter space of direct impact double white dwarf binaries. We find a significant decrease in the amount of angular momentum removed from the orbit during mass transfer, as well as cases where this process increases the angular momentum of the orbit at the expense of the spin angular momentum of the donor. We conclude that, unlike earlier claims in the literature, mass transfer through direct impact need not destabilize the binary and that the quantity and sign of the orbital angular momentum transfer depends on the binary properties. This stabilization may significantly impact the population synthesis calculations of double white dwarf progenitors.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 6 figures.

To obtain deeper understanding of this process, we performed laboratory and drop-tower experiments to study multiple impacts of small, porous dust-aggregate projectiles onto sintered dust targets. Projectile and target consisted of 1.5 micron monodisperse, spherical SiO2 monomers with volume filling factors of 0.15 (projectiles) and 0.45 (targets). The projectiles were accelerated by a solenoid magnet and combined with a magazine with which 25 impacts onto the same spot on the target could be performed in vacuum. We measured the mass-accretion efficiency and the volume filling factor for different impact velocities between 1.5 and 6.0 m/s. The experiments at the lowest impact speeds were performed in the Bremen drop-tower under microgravity conditions. Within this velocity range we found a linear increase of the accretion efficiency with increasing velocity. In the laboratory experiments, the accretion efficiency increases from 0.12 to 0.21 in units of the projectile mass. The recorded images of the impacts showed that the mass transfer from the projectile to the target leads to the growth of a conical structure on the target. From the images we also measured the volume filling factors of the grown structures, which ranged from 0.15 (uncompacted) to 0.40 (significantly compacted) with increasing impact speed. These results augment our knowledge of the aggregate growth in protoplanetary disks and should be taken into account for future models of protoplanetary dust growth.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted by The Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4341","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T19:51:09Z","registered":"2022-03-13T19:51:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T19:51:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

CARTs are traditionally built by means of a greedy procedure, sequentially deciding the splitting predictor variable(s) and the associated threshold. This greedy approach trains trees very fast, but, by its nature, their classification accuracy may not be competitive against other state-of-the-art procedures. Moreover, controlling critical issues, such as the misclassification rates in each of the classes, is difficult. To address these shortcomings, optimal decision trees have been recently proposed in the literature, which use discrete decision variables to model the path each observation will follow in the tree. Instead, we propose a new approach based on continuous optimization. Our classifier can be seen as a randomized tree, since at each node of the decision tree a random decision is made. The computational experience reported demonstrates the good performance of our procedure.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"This research has been financed in part by research projects EC H2020 MSCA RISE NeEDS (Grant agreement ID: 822214), FQM-329 and P18-FR-2369 (Junta de Andaluc\\'ia), and PID2019-110886RB-I00 (Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovaci\\'on y Universidades, Spain).

Importantly, by doing away with dedicated macroscopic devices for inducing a quench -- using instead the indispensable measurement apparatus only -- the protocol is expected to be easier to implement and more resilient against decoherence. By way of various case studies, we show that our scheme also has decisive advantages beyond reducing decoherence -- for spectroscopy purposes and probing nonequilibrium scaling of critical and quantum impurity many-body systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09643","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T09:31:23Z","registered":"2022-03-02T09:31:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T09:31:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A lot of researchers deal with the testing process in terms of tester motivation and how tests should or should not be written. However, it is not known from the recommendations how the tests are written in real projects. In this paper, the following was investigated: (i) the denotation of the word \"test\" in different natural languages; (ii) whether the number of occurrences of the word \"test\" correlates with the number of test cases; and (iii) what testing frameworks are mostly used. The analysis was performed on 38 GitHub open source repositories thoroughly selected from the set of 4.3M GitHub projects. We analyzed 20,340 test cases in 803 classes manually and 170k classes using an automated approach. The results show that: (i) there exists a weak correlation (r = 0.655) between the number of occurrences of the word \"test\" and the number of test cases in a class; (ii) the proposed algorithm using static file analysis correctly detected 97% of test cases; (iii) 15% of the analyzed classes used main() function whose represent regular Java programs that test the production code without using any third-party framework. The identification of such tests is very complex due to implementation diversity. The results may be leveraged to more quickly identify and locate test cases in a repository, to understand practices in customized testing solutions, and to mine tests to improve program comprehension in the future.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, accepted in Computing and Informatics Journal - http://www.cai.sk, ISSN 2585-8807","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11678","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T15:59:04Z","registered":"2022-02-23T15:59:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T15:59:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. However, in each hemisphere there is a small subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the observations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the models are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated internal climate variability is taken into account. Here we examine sea ice changes during 1979-2013 in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close relationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea ice extent. We find that all of the simulations with 1979-2013 Arctic sea ice retreat as fast as observed have considerably more global warming than observations during this time period. Using two separate methods to estimate the sea ice retreat that would occur under the observed level of global warming in each simulation in both ensembles, we find that simulated Arctic sea ice retreat as fast as observed would occur less than 1% of the time. This implies that the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Antarctic, we find that simulated sea ice expansion as fast as observed typically corresponds with too little global warming, although these results are more equivocal. We show that because of this, the simulations do not capture the observed asymmetry between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice trends. This suggests that the models may be getting the right sea ice trends for the wrong reasons in both polar regions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08519","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T02:11:28Z","registered":"2022-03-06T02:11:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T02:11:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The detected polarisation values of HESS J0632+057, just after periastron passage (March 24), are higher than all previously published values (p(V) ~ 4.2%) and the position angle (theta ~ 171-172 degrees) is also different by ~6-10 degrees from previously published values. The data obtained just before the subsequent periastron passage (December 12) show statistically lower polarisation in all photometric bands (p(V) ~ 3.9%) and a different position angle theta ~ 167-168 degrees. From observations of a nearby field star, the interstellar component of the measured polarisation was estimated as p_is(V) ~ 0.65% and theta_is ~ 153 degrees. This estimate was used with the previous \"V\"-band estimation by \"field-stars method\" (p(V) ~ 2% and theta_is ~ 165 degrees) of Yudin (2014) to identify the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic polarisation in HESS J0632+057. It was found that after subtraction of the interstellar component (for both p_is estimates), the wavelength dependence of the intrinsic polarisation in HESS J0632+057 is essentially flat. We propose that the formation of an additional source of polarisation or some perturbation of circumstellar material at this orbital phase can explain the changes in the level of polarisation in HESS J0632+057 close to periastron passage.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS on 2016 October 14","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04792","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T20:24:33Z","registered":"2022-03-05T20:24:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T20:24:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The popular rigid band approximation (RBA), where both the band structure and the exchange splitting are held fixed before and after laser excitation, is unsuitable for this purpose, while the time-dependent density functional theory could be time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a time-dependent Liouville and density functional theory (TDLDFT) that integrates the time-dependent Liouville equation into the density functional theory. As a result, the excited charge density is reiterated back into the Kohn-Sham equation, and the band structure is allowed to change dynamically. Even with the ground-state density functional, a larger demagnetization than RBA is found; after we expand Ortenzi's spin scaling method into an excited-state (laser) density functional, we find that the exchange splitting is indeed strongly reduced, as seen in the experiment. Both the majority and minority bands are shifted toward the Fermi level, but the majority shifts a lot more. The ultrafast reduction in exchange splitting occurs concomitantly with demagnetization. While our current theory is still unable to yield the same percentage loss in the spin moment as observed in the experiment, it predicts a correct trend that agrees with the experiments. With a better functional, we believe that our results can be further improved.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03156","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T19:48:45Z","registered":"2022-03-05T19:48:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T19:48:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Such approximations allow us to use off-the-shelf semidefinite optimization solvers for convex optimization problems involving the matrix logarithm and related functions, such as the quantum relative entropy. The basic ingredients of our approach apply, beyond the matrix logarithm, to functions that are operator concave and operator monotone.

For the first time, we present a quantitative evaluation of different computationally and communication efficient FL methods from the perspectives of energy consumption and carbon equivalent emissions, suggesting also general guidelines for energy-efficient design. Results indicate that consensus-driven FL implementations should be preferred for limiting carbon emissions when the energy efficiency of the communication is low (i.e., &lt; 25 Kbit/Joule). Besides, quantization and sparsification operations are shown to strike a balance between learning performances and energy consumption, leading to sustainable FL designs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted for presentation at IEEE CAMAD 2023","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08087","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-10-13T01:24:00Z","registered":"2023-10-13T01:24:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-05-27T02:04:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

LCs are obtained by modeling the disk thermodynamics with an adiabatic equation of state, a local blackbody cooling prescription, and corrections to approximate the effects of radiation pressure. We find that modulation of multi-band LCs on the orbital time scale are generally in-phase (to within $\\sim\\,$2% of a binary orbital period), but they contain pulse substructure in the time domain that is not necessarily reflected in BH accretion rates $\\dot M$. We thus predict that binary-hosting AGN will exhibit highly correlated, in-phase, periodic brightness modulations in their low-energy disk emission. However, detectability of these modulations in multi-wavelength observing campaigns could be seriously compromised because observed stochastic variability in AGNs typically has a higher amplitude than our proposed signal. It is possible that observations over temporal baselines of many binary periods may make the signal more prominent, but this would need to be analyzed carefully. If jet emission is predicted by $\\dot{M}$, then we predict a weaker correlation with low-energy disk emission due to the differing sub-peak structure. For the binary parameters we explore, we show that LC variability due to hydrodynamics likely dominates Doppler brightening for all equal-mass binaries with disk Mach numbers $\\lesssim 20$. A promising signature of eccentricity is weak or absent \"lump\" periodicity. We find hints that a significant lag exists between $\\dot{M}$ and low-energy disk emission for circular binaries, but they are in-phase for eccentric binaries, which might explain some \"orphan\" blazar flares with no $\u03b3$-ray counterpart.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"v6: accepted version (PRD)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06882","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-20T07:00:06Z","registered":"2022-02-20T07:00:08Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-11-14T01:58:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, their heterogeneity and high dimensionality may represent an obstacle for their interpretation. The introduction of a priori knowledge seems the best option to mitigate high dimensionality problems, but could lose some information and patterns present in the data, while data heterogeneity remains an open issue that often makes generalization difficult. In this study, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection that can be used with a supervised or unsupervised approach. Our proposal considers three different fitness functions without relying on expert knowledge. Starting from two publicly available datasets on cognitive workload and motor movement/imagery, the EEG signals are processed, normalized and their features computed in the time, frequency and time-frequency domains. The feature vector selection is performed by applying our GA proposal and compared with two benchmarking techniques. The results show that different combinations of our proposal achieve better results in respect to the benchmark in terms of overall performance and feature reduction. Moreover, the proposed GA, based on a novel fitness function here presented, outperforms the benchmark when the two different datasets considered are merged together, showing the effectiveness of our proposal on heterogeneous data.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted by Expert Systems with Applications (see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417422025076)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07117","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-22T06:17:27Z","registered":"2022-02-22T06:17:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-10-26T01:50:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this model, the intra-dimer exchange coupling J&gt;0 is antiferromagnetic, while the inter-dimer exchange couplings are ferromagnetic and take different values, J_x,J_y&lt;0, in the two bond directions. Anticipating that the highly frustrated character of this model may lead to a wide range of behaviors in (CuCl)LaNb2O7 and related compounds, we theoretically investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model in detail using the following three approaches: a strong-coupling expansion for small J_x and J_y, exact diagonalization for finite clusters, and a Schwinger boson mean field theory. When |J_x|, |J_y| ~ J, quantum phase transitions to various magnetically ordered phases (ferromagnetic, collinear stripe, and spiral) occur. The Schwinger boson analysis demonstrates that quantum fluctuations split the classical degeneracy of different spiral ground states. Implications for (CuCl)LaNb2O7 and related compounds are discussed in light of our theoretical results and existing experimental data.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"21 pages, 20 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5017","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T09:09:22Z","registered":"2022-03-14T09:09:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T09:09:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This paper presents an FHD formulation for isothermal reactive incompressible liquid mixtures with stochastic chemistry. Fluctuating multispecies mass diffusion is formulated using a Maxwell-Stefan description without assuming a dilute solution, and momentum dynamics is described by a stochastic Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. We consider a thermodynamically consistent generalization for the law of mass action for non-dilute mixtures and use it in the chemical master equation (CME) to model reactions as a Poisson process. The FHD approach provides remarkable computational efficiency over traditional reaction-diffusion master equation methods when the number of reactive molecules is large, while also retaining accuracy even when there are as few as ten reactive molecules per hydrodynamic cell. We present a numerical algorithm to solve the coupled FHD and CME equations and validate it on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium problems. We simulate a diffusively-driven gravitational instability in the presence of an acid-base neutralization reaction, starting from a perfectly flat interface. We demonstrate that the coupling between velocity and concentration fluctuations dominate the initial growth of the instability.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03389","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T09:56:22Z","registered":"2022-03-02T09:56:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T09:56:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The latter implies disappearance of the volume element $\\sqrt{-g}d^4x$ of 4-D space-time. We pay attention that besides $\\sqrt{-g}$, the 4-D space-time differentiable manifold possesses also a \"manifold volume measure\" (MVM)described by a 4-form which is sign indefinite and generically independent of the metric. The FOF proceeds with originally independent connection and metric structures of the space-time manifold. We bring up the question whether the FOF should be supplemented with degrees of freedom of MVM. Adding such manifold degrees of freedom to the action principle in the FOF we realize very interesting dynamics. Such Two Measures Theory enables radically new approaches to resolution of the cosmological constant problem. We show that fine tuning free solutions describing a transition to $\u039b=0$ state involve oscillations of $g_{\u03bc\u03bd}$ and MVM around zero. The latter can be treated as a dynamics involving changes of orientation of the space-time manifold. As we have shown earlier, in realistic scale invariant models (SIM), solutions formulated in the Einstein frame satisfy all existing tests of General Relativity (GR). Here we reveal surprisingly that in SIM, all ground state solutions with $\u039b\\neq 0$ appear to be degenerate either in $g_{00}$ or in MVM.

We here provide yet another fundamental connection between this biochemical spin system and quantum information science. We introduce and explore a formal measure quantifying singlet-triplet coherence of radical-pairs using the concept of quantum relative entropy. The ability to quantify singlet-triplet coherence opens up a number of possibilities in the study of magnetic sensing with radical-pairs. We first use the explicit quantification of singlet-triplet coherence to affirmatively address the major premise of quantum biology, namely that quantum coherence provides an operational advantage to magnetoreception. Secondly, we use the concept of incoherent operations to show that incoherent manipulations of nuclear spins can have a dire effect on singlet-triplet coherence when the radical-pair exhibits electronic-nuclear entanglement. Finally, we unravel subtle effects related to exchange interactions and their role in promoting quantum coherence.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09319","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T01:21:51Z","registered":"2022-02-27T01:21:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T01:21:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Thus, usual dietary intake is assessed with considerable measurement error. Also, diet represents numerous foods, nutrients and other components, each of which have distinctive attributes. Sometimes, it is useful to examine intake of these components separately, but increasingly nutritionists are interested in exploring them collectively to capture overall dietary patterns. Consumption of these components varies widely: some are consumed daily by almost everyone on every day, while others are episodically consumed so that 24-hour recall data are zero-inflated. In addition, they are often correlated with each other. Finally, it is often preferable to analyze the amount of a dietary component relative to the amount of energy (calories) in a diet because dietary recommendations often vary with energy level. The quest to understand overall dietary patterns of usual intake has to this point reached a standstill. There are no statistical methods or models available to model such complex multivariate data with its measurement error and zero inflation. This paper proposes the first such model, and it proposes the first workable solution to fit such a model. After describing the model, we use survey-weighted MCMC computations to fit the model, with uncertainty estimation coming from balanced repeated replication.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/10-AOAS446 the Annals of Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4868","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T21:33:49Z","registered":"2022-03-12T21:33:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T21:33:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This can lead to a finite-time disappearance of entanglement, which is known as entanglement sudden death (ESD). Here, we consider an initially entangled qubit-qutrit system and a dissipative noise which leads to ESD, and propose a set of local unitary operations, which when applied on the qubit, qutrit, or both subsystems during the decoherence process, cause ESD to be hastened, delayed, or avoided altogether, depending on its time of application. The physical implementation of these local unitaries is discussed in the context of an atomic system. The simulation results of such ESD manipulations are presented for two different classes of initially entangled qubit-qutrit systems. A prescription for generalization of this scheme to a qutrit-qutrit system is given. This technique for entanglement protection in the noisy environment is compared with other related techniques such as weak measurement reversal and dynamic decoupling.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages (to be published version)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07604","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-26T22:25:26Z","registered":"2022-02-26T22:25:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-07-22T01:15:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

By modeling the multi-wavelength dataset, we derive a photometric redshift of z~6.0, which we confirm with a low signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the afterglow. We find that a model with a constant-density environment provides a good fit to the afterglow data, with an inferred density of 0.05/cm^3. The radio observations reveal the presence of a jet break at 7 d, corresponding to a jet opening angle of ~ 3 deg. The beaming-corrected gamma-ray and kinetic energies are both ~ 3e50 erg. We quantify the uncertainties in our results using a detailed Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, which allows us to uncover degeneracies between the physical parameters of the explosion. To compare GRB 120521C to other high-redshift bursts in a uniform manner we re-fit all available afterglow data for the two other bursts at z&gt;6 with radio detections (GRBs 050904 and 090423). We find a jet break at ~ 15 d for GRB 090423, in contrast to previous work. Based on these three events, we find that GRBs at z&gt;6 appear to explode in constant-density environments, and exhibit a wide range of energies and densities that span the range inferred for lower redshift bursts. On the other hand, we find a hint for narrower jets in the z&gt;6 bursts, potentially indicating a larger true event rate at these redshifts. Overall, our results indicate that long GRBs share a common progenitor population at least to z~8.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"67 pages, 22 figures, submitted to ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6586","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T18:22:46Z","registered":"2022-03-10T18:22:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T18:22:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The proposed strategy relies on a Newton-like iterative solver which only requires evaluations of the residual of the parameter-dependent equation and of a preconditioner (such as the differential of the residual) for instances of the parameters independently. The algorithm provides an approximation of the set of solutions associated with a possibly large number of instances of the parameters, with a computational complexity which can be orders of magnitude lower than when using the same Newton-like solver for all instances of the parameters. The reduction of complexity requires efficient strategies for obtaining low-rank approximations of the residual, of the preconditioner, and of the increment at each iteration of the algorithm. For the approximation of the residual and the preconditioner, weakly intrusive variants of the empirical interpolation method are introduced, which require evaluations of entries of the residual and the preconditioner. Then, an approximation of the increment is obtained by using a greedy algorithm for low-rank approximation, and a low-rank approximation of the iterate is finally obtained by using a truncated singular value decomposition. When the preconditioner is the differential of the residual, the proposed algorithm is interpreted as an inexact Newton solver for which a detailed convergence analysis is provided.

These couplings which have both world-volume and transverse indices, are invariant under the linear T-duality transformations. Consistency with the nonlinear T-duality indicates that the RR field strength $F^{(p)}$ in these couplings should be replaced by ${\\cal F}^{(p)}=d{\\cal C}^{(p-1)}$ where ${\\cal C}=e^{B}C$. This replacement, however, reproduces some non-gauge invariant terms. On the other hand, the nonlinear terms are invariant under the linear T-duality transformations at the level of two B-fields. This allows one to remove some of the nonlinear terms in ${\\cal F}^{(p)}$. We fix this by comparing the nonlinear couplings with the S-matrix element of one RR and two NSNS vertex operators. Our results indicate that in the expansion of ${\\cal F}^{(p)}$ one should keep only the B-field gauge invariant terms, e.g. $B\\wedge dC^{(p-3)}$ where both indices of B-field lie along the brane. Moreover, in this case one should replace $B$ with $B+2\u03c0\u03b1'f$ to have the $B$-field gauge invariance.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages, Latex file, 1 figure; v2:typos corrected, to appear in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2747","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T21:02:42Z","registered":"2022-03-13T21:02:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T21:02:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The boundary action is the sum of two pieces: a periodic potential and a coupling to a uniform abelian gauge field. Such models arise in open string theory and dissipative quantum mechanics, and possibly in edge state tunneling in the fractional quantized Hall effect. We explicitly show that conformal invariance is unbroken for certain special choices of the gauge field and the periodic potential. These special cases are naturally indexed by semi-simple, simply laced Lie algebras. For each such algebra, we have a discrete series of conformally invariant theories where the potential and gauge field are conveniently given in terms of the weight lattice of the algebra. We compute the exact boundary state for these theories, which explicitly shows the group structure. The partition function and correlation functions are easily computed using the boundary state result.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"24 pages in plain tex, requires harvmac.tex","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9504104","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T10:47:46Z","registered":"2022-03-20T10:47:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T10:47:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The constructed model can describe all available experimental data in both $\u03b3p \\to K^+\u039b$ and $\u03b3n\\to K^0\u039b$ channels, simultaneously. The background part of the model is built from the appropriate intermediate states involving the nucleon, kaon, and hyperon exchanges, whereas the resonance part is constructed from the consistent interaction Lagrangians and propagators. To check the performance of the model a detailed comparison between the calculated observables and experimental data in both isospin channels is presented, from which a nice agreement can be observed. The discrepancy between the CLAS and MAMI data in the $\u03b3n\\to K^0\u039b$ channel is analyzed by utilizing three different models; M1, M2, and M3 that fit the CLAS, MAMI, and both CLAS and MAMI data sets, respectively. The effect of this discrepancy is studied by investigating the significance of individual nucleon resonances and the predicted beam-target helicity asymmetry $E$ that has been measured by the CLAS collaboration recently. It is found that the $N(1720)P_{13}$, $N(1900)P_{13}$, and $N(2060)D_{15}$ resonances are significant for improving the agreement between model calculation and data. This result is relatively stable to the choice of the model. The helicity asymmetry $E$ can be better explained by the models M1 and M3. Finally, the effect of the $N(1680)P_{11}$ narrow resonance on the cross section of both isospin channels is explored. It is found that the effect is more sensitive in the $\u03b3n\\to K^0\u039b$ channel. In this case the model M3, that fits both CLAS and MAMI data, yields a more realistic effect.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, 11 figures, submitted to Phys. Rev.

Elucidating the mechanisms that control autoinducer production is, thus, pertinent to understanding collective microbial behavior, such as virulence and bioluminescence. Recent experiments have shown a heterogeneous promoter activity of autoinducer synthase genes, suggesting that some of the isogenic cells in a population might produce autoinducers, whereas others might not. However, the mechanism underlying this phenotypic heterogeneity in quorum-sensing microbial populations has remained elusive. In our theoretical model, cells synthesize and secrete autoinducers into the environment, up-regulate their production in this self-shaped environment, and non-producers replicate faster than producers. We show that the coupling between ecological and population dynamics through quorum sensing can induce phenotypic heterogeneity in microbial populations, suggesting an alternative mechanism to stochastic gene expression in bistable gene regulatory circuits.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"44 pages, 7 figures, 3 linked videos","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07959","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T00:46:35Z","registered":"2022-03-04T00:46:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T00:46:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It therefore provides a very powerful {\\em indirect} evidence against spatial gradients or temporal variation in the other fundamental physical parameters, at least 40 orders of magnitude more powerful than direct experimental constraints. Moreover, a gradient may potentially appear in theories where the variability of the cosmological constant is connected to an anthropic selection mechanism, invoked to explain the smallness of this parameter. In the Hubble damping mechanism for anthropic selection, I calculate the possible gradient. While this mechanism demonstrates the existence of this effect, it is too small to be seen experimentally, except possibly if inflation happens around the Planck scale.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0101130","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T00:47:35Z","registered":"2022-03-20T00:47:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T00:47:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is usually assumed to be around 1:100 in the case of Galactic sources, while a value of 1:10 is typically assumed when describing extragalactic sources. It is supported by observations that the average ratios should be close to these values. At this point, however, there is no possibility to investigate how each individual source behaves. When looking at the physics aspects, a 1:100 ratio is well supported in theory when making the following assumptions: (1) the total number of electrons and protons that is accelerated are the same; (2) the spectral index of both populations after acceleration is $a_e=a_p\\approx 2.2$. In this paper, we reinvestigate these assumptions. In particular, assumption (2) is not supported by observational data of the sources and PIC simulation yield different spectral indices as well. We present the detailed calculation of the electron-to-proton ratio, dropping the assumption of equal spectral indices. We distinguish between the ratio of luminosities and the ratio of the differential spectral behavior, which becomes necessary for cases where the spectral indices of the two particle populations are not the same. We discuss the possible range of values when allowing for different spectral indices concerning the spectral behavior of electrons and protons. Additionally, it is shown that the minimum energy of the accelerated population can have a large influence on the results.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Astroparticle Physics (02/24/2017)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07523","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T20:45:49Z","registered":"2022-03-04T20:45:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T20:45:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

As a result, FM leaderboards have become essential tools for SE teams to compare and select the best third-party FMs for their specific products and purposes. However, the lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in real-world scenarios (\"leaderboard operations\") and identifying potential pitfalls and areas for improvement (\"leaderboard smells\"). In this regard, we collect up to 1,045 FM leaderboards from five different sources: GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces, Papers With Code, spreadsheet and independent platform, to examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard operators to understand their workflows. Through card sorting and negotiated agreement, we identify five distinct workflow patterns and develop a domain model that captures the key components and their interactions within these workflows. We then identify eight unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps. By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Awesome Foundation Model Leaderboard List: https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards; Foundation Model Leaderboard Search Toolkit: https://huggingface.co/spaces/zhiminy/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboard-search","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04065","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-07-08T02:52:56Z","registered":"2024-07-08T02:52:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-01-30T02:55:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Finally, we have obtained analytical solutions to the skyrmion position when the in-plane distance between the skyrmions is small and it is shown that an attractive RKKY interaction yields a skyrmion precessory motion.

Firstly, we review some recent results on the maximum likelihood estimation in the regression model of the form $X_t = \u03b8G(t) + B_t$, where $B$ is a Gaussian process, $G(t)$ is a known function, and $\u03b8$ is an unknown drift parameter. The estimation techniques for the cases of discrete-time and continuous-time observations are presented. As examples, models with fractional Brownian motion, mixed fractional Brownian motion, and sub-fractional Brownian motion are considered. Secondly, we study in detail the model with two independent fractional Brownian motions and apply the general results mentioned above to this model.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08417","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T23:24:13Z","registered":"2022-03-01T23:24:14Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T23:24:14Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}
