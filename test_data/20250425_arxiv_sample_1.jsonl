This integral first contributes to the parity-odd part of the one-loop N=4 five-point MHV amplitude m_5^{(1)} at O(eps). In the high energy limit defined, the pentagon integral reduces to double sums or equivalently two-fold Mellin-Barnes integrals. By determining the O(eps) contribution to I_5^{6-2 eps}, one therefore gains knowledge of m_5^{(1)} through to O(eps^2) which is necessary for studies of the iterative structure of N=4 SYM amplitudes beyond one-loop. One immediate application is the extraction of the one-loop gluon-production vertex through to O(eps^2) and the iterative construction of the two-loop gluon-production vertex through to finite terms which is described in a companion paper. The analytic methods we have used for evaluating the pentagon integral in the high energy limit may also be applied to the hexagon integral and may ultimately give information on the form of the remainder function.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"60 pages, 1 figure","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0097","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T10:57:22Z","registered":"2022-03-15T10:57:24Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T10:57:24Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In motion guidance, the \"feedforward\" provides instructional cues of the motions that are to be performed, whereas the \"feedback\" provides cues which help correct mistakes and minimize errors. Designing synergistic feedforward and feedback is vital to providing an effective learning experience, but this interplay between the two has not yet been adequately explored. Based on a survey of the literature, we propose design space for both motion feedforward and corrective feedback in XR, and describe the interaction effects between them. We identify common design approaches of XR-based motion guidance found in our literature corpus, and discuss them through the lens of our design dimensions. We then discuss additional contextual factors and considerations that influence this design, together with future research opportunities for motion guidance in XR.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"To appear in ACM CHI 2024","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09182","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-02-15T02:33:00Z","registered":"2024-02-15T02:33:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-02-19T02:49:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the preheating process at the end of inflation, parametric resonance can generate large energy density perturbations and efficiently produce gravitational waves (GWs) which carry unique information about inflation. Since the peak frequency of such GWs is approximately proportional to the inflationary energy scale, $\u039b_{\\mathrm{inf}}$, GWs from preheating are expected to be observed by interferometer GW detectors in low-scale inflationary models. We investigate the dependence of the amplitude of such GWs on $\u039b_{\\mathrm{inf}}$, and find that the present energy spectrum of these GWs does not depend on $\u039b_{\\mathrm{inf}}$ only in the case of $\u039b_{\\mathrm{inf}}$ is above a critical value $\u039b_{c}$, a parameter depending on the resonance strength. We numerically obtain $\u039b_{c}$ in terms of the model parameters in linear approximation and then conduct lattice simulations to verify this result. For $\u039b_{\\mathrm{inf}}\\lesssim\u039b_{c}$, the amplitude of GWs quickly decreases with $\u039b_{\\mathrm{inf}}$ and becomes challenging to observe. In turn, observing such GWs in interferometer detectors also helps to determine $\u039b_{\\mathrm{inf}}$ and the resonance strength during the preheating.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00427","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-22T11:20:32Z","registered":"2022-02-22T11:20:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-22T11:20:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Polaris is specifically designed for studying network polarization, where vertices belong to a side in a debate or a partisan group, represented by a vertex color, and relations have different strengths, represented by an integer-valued edge multiplicity. The key feature of Polaris is preserving the Joint Color Matrix (JCM) of the multigraph, which specifies the number of edges connecting vertices of any two given colors. The JCM is the basic property that determines color assortativity, a fundamental aspect in studying homophily and segregation in polarized networks. By using Polaris, network scientists can test whether a phenomenon is entirely explained by the JCM of the observed network or whether other phenomena might be at play. Technically, our null model is an extension of the configuration model: an ensemble of colored multigraphs characterized by the same degree sequence and the same JCM. To sample from this ensemble, we develop a suite of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, collectively named Polaris-*. It includes Polaris-B, an adaptation of a generic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and Polaris-C, a faster, specialized algorithm with higher acceptance probabilities. This new null model and the associated algorithms provide a more nuanced toolset for examining polarization in social networks, thus enabling statistically sound conclusions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication at WSDM2025","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01363","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-09-04T04:34:22Z","registered":"2024-09-04T04:34:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-12-19T03:27:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A notable finding is that there are previously unnoticed apparent discrepancies between the definitions of the so-called interference DiFF (IFF) $H_1^\\sphericalangle$, entering the cross sections for two-hadron semi-inclusive electroproduction, and those involved in the production of two pairs of hadrons from back-to-back jets in electron-positron annihilation.

This complexity has motivated a large body of research on the utility, reliability, and behavioral correlates of course rankings. There is, however, little investigation of the (potential) implicit student bias on these forums towards desirable course outcomes at the institution level. To that end, we examine the connection between course outcomes (student-reported GPA) and the overall ranking of the primary course instructor, as well as rating disparity by nature of course outcomes, based on data from two popular academic rating forums.

We report an unusual example of a CDW in BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ below 100 K. In contrast to the canonical CDW phase transition, temperature dependent physical properties of single crystals reveal a first-order phase transition. This is accompanied by a discontinuous change in the size of the crystal lattice. In fact, this large strain has catastrophic consequences for the crystals causing them to physically shatter. Single crystal x-ray diffraction reveals super-lattice peaks in the low-temperature phase signaling the development of a CDW lattice modulation. No similar low-temperature transitions are observed in BaCo$_2$Al$_9$. Electronic structure calculations provide one hint to the different behavior of these two compounds; the d-orbital states in the Fe compound are not completely filled. Iron compounds are renowned for their magnetism and partly filled d-states play a key role. It is therefore surprising that BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ develops a structural modulation instead at low temperature instead of magnetic order.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"34 pages, 8 figures Edits to text as well as figures 2 and 5.

We take advantage of a sample of $25$ high signal-to-noise ratio QSO spectra to retrieve $150$ triply-ionised carbon (\\cfour) absorbers at $4.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim 6.2$, of which $37$ systems whose expected H{~\\small I} absorption lie in the Lyman-$\u03b1$ forest. We derive improved constraints on the cosmic density of \\cfour \\,at $4.3&lt; z &lt; 6.2$ and infer from abundance-matching that \\cfour \\,absorbers trace $M_{\\text{UV}}\\lesssim -16$ galaxies. Correlation with the Lyman-$\u03b1$ forest of the QSOs indicates that these objects are surrounded by a highly opaque region at $r\\lesssim 5 $ cMpc/h followed by an excess of transmission at $r\\gtrsim 10$ cMpc/h detected at $2.7\u03c3$. This is in contrast to equivalent measurements at lower redshifts where only the opaque trough is detected. We interpret this excess as a statistical enhancement of the local photoionisation rate due to clustered faint galaxies around the \\cfour \\,absorbers. Using the analytical framework described in Paper I of this series, we derive a constraint on the average product of the escape fraction and the Lyman continuum photon production efficiency of the galaxy population clustered around the \\cfour \\,absorbers, $\\log \\langle f_{\\text{esc}}\u03be_{\\text{ion}}\\rangle /[{\\rm erg^{-1}~Hz}] = 25.01^{+0.30}_{-0.19}$.

Traditional generalization methods, such as the VC dimension, do not apply to deep neural network (DNN) models. Thus, new theories to explain the generalizability of DNNs are required. In this study, we hypothesize that the DNN with a simpler decision boundary has better generalizability by the law of parsimony (Occam's Razor). We create the decision boundary complexity (DBC) score to define and measure the complexity of decision boundary of DNNs. The idea of the DBC score is to generate data points (called adversarial examples) on or near the decision boundary. Our new approach then measures the complexity of the boundary using the entropy of eigenvalues of these data. The method works equally well for high-dimensional data. We use training data and the trained model to compute the DBC score. And, the ground truth for model's generalizability is its test accuracy. Experiments based on the DBC score have verified our hypothesis. The DBC is shown to provide an effective method to measure the complexity of a decision boundary and gives a quantitative measure of the generalizability of DNNs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 11 figures.

The field equations now correspond to the total matter configuration. We transform the radial metric component to split these equations into two sets characterizing their parent sources. The unknowns comprising in the first set are determined by considering the Buchdahl isotropic solution. On the other hand, we employ different constraints related to the additional gravitational source and make the second system solvable. Further, the constant triplet in Buchdahl solution is calculated by means of matching criteria between the interior and exterior geometries at the spherical boundary. The mass and radius of a compact star LMC X-4 are used to analyze the physical relevancy of the developed models.

In turn, the active nuclei drive galactic-scale outflows that subsequently impact the evolution of the host galaxies. The details of this transformative process as they pertain to the supermassive black holes remain ambiguous, partially due to the central obscuration commonly found in the dust-reddened merger hosts, and also because there are relatively few laboratories in the nearby universe where the process can be studied in depth. This review highlights the current state of the literature on the role of accreting supermassive black holes in local luminous infrared galaxies as seen from various windows within the electromagnetic spectrum. Specifically, we discuss the multiwavelength signatures of the active nucleus, its associated feeding and feedback processes, and the implications of multiple supermassive black holes found in nearby interacting galaxy systems for galaxy evolution from the observational perspective. We conclude with a future outlook on how the topic of active nuclei in low- and high-redshift galaxy mergers will benefit from the advent of next-generation observing facilities with unparalleled resolving power and sensitivity in the coming decade.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Invited Review, published in Universe Special Issue \"Recent Advances in Infrared Galaxies and AGN\" with open access; 32 pages (excluding references), 19 figures, 1 table","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13690","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-07-28T01:06:27Z","registered":"2022-07-28T01:06:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-07-28T01:06:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The length of a $k$-mer varies from 2 to 128. Effect of $k$-mer alignment on the jamming threshold is examined. For completely ordered systems where all the $k$-mers are aligned along one direction (e.g., vertical), the obtained simulation data are very close to the known analytical results for 1d systems. In particular, the jamming threshold tends to the R{\u00e9}nyi's Parking Constant for large $k$. In the other extreme case, when $k$-mers are fully disordered, our results correspond to the published results for short $k$-mers. It was observed that for partially oriented systems the jamming configurations consist of the blocks of vertically and horizontally oriented $k$-mers ($v$- and $h$-blocks, respectively) and large voids between them. The relative areas of different blocks and voids depend on the order parameter $s$, $k$-mer length and type of the model. For small $k$-mers ($k\\leqslant 4$), denser configurations are observed in disordered systems as compared to those of completely ordered systems.

Methods, An optimized golden angle ordering radial UTE sequence was used to continuously acquire data for 5 minutes. All readouts were grouped to different respiratory motion states based on self-navigator signals, then motion resolved data was reconstructed by XD Golden angle RAdial Sparse Parallel reconstruction (XD GRASP). One state from the motion resolved images was selected as a reference, and motion fields from the other states to the reference were derived via non-rigid registration. Finally, all motion resolved data and motion fields were reconstructed by using an iterative motion compensation reconstruction with a total generalized variation sparse constraint. Results, The iMoCo UTE strategy was evaluated in volunteers and non-sedated pediatric patient(4-6 y/o) studies. Images reconstructed with iMoCo UTE provided sharper anatomical lung structures, and higher apparent SNR and CNR, compared to using other motion correction strategies, such as soft-gating, motion resolved reconstruction, and non-rigid motion compensation(MoCo). iMoCo UTE also showed promising results in an infant study. Conclusions, The proposed iMoCo UTE combines self-navigation, motion modeling, and a compressed sensing reconstruction to increase scan efficiency, SNR, and reduce respiratory motion in lung MRI. This proposed strategy shows improvements in free breathing lung MRI scans, especially in very challenging application situations, such as pediatric MRI studies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11993","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T00:22:26Z","registered":"2022-02-27T00:22:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T00:22:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We show the same is true for six of the seven other DIBs presented here. Despite this similarity, the eight strong DIBs chosen are not well enough correlated with each other to suggest they come from the same carrier. We further conclude that these eight DIBs are more likely to be associated with H than with H2, and hence are not preferentially located in the densest, most UV shielded parts of interstellar clouds. We suggest they arise from different molecules found in diffuse H regions with very little H (molecular fraction f&lt;0.01). Of the 133 stars with available data in our study, there are three with significantly weaker \u03bb5780.5 than our mean H-5780.5 relationship, all of which are in regions of high radiation fields, as previously noted by Herbig.

We comment on correlations between interior hole and collective edge fluctuations, and on the implications of these correlations for edge excitation models in bulk systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0203035","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T09:06:19Z","registered":"2022-03-19T09:06:20Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T09:06:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Based on the achieved performances, existing approaches can be broadly classified into perfect accuracy-prioritized approaches such as secure multiparty computation (SMPC), and worst-case privacy-prioritized approaches such as differential privacy (DP). Methods of the first class achieve perfect output accuracy but reveal some private information, while methods from the second class provide privacy against the strongest adversary at the cost of a loss of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a general approach named adaptive differentially quantized subspace perturbation (ADQSP) which combines quantization schemes with so-called subspace perturbation. Although not relying on cryptographic primitives, the proposed approach enjoys the benefits of both accuracy-prioritized and privacy-prioritized methods and is able to unify them. More specifically, we show that by varying a single quantization parameter the proposed method can vary between SMPC-type performances and DP-type performances. Our results show the potential of exploiting traditional distributed signal processing tools for providing cryptographic guarantees. In addition to a comprehensive theoretical analysis, numerical validations are conducted to substantiate our results.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07947","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-12-14T02:29:00Z","registered":"2023-12-14T02:29:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-07-16T03:28:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We investigate the protocol in detail, calculating mutual informations through a pair of analytic methods and comparing the results to the outputs of a Monte Carlo simulation of the protocol. In a lossless system, we find that a lower bound on the key rate remains positive in the protocol under a beam splitter attack, provided Bob receives a nonzero proportion of the beam initially sent to him.

Starting from the equations of motions in plasma medium, we have shown how the shadow radius of the RGI black hole is modified. To this end, we have computed the deflection angle of light in the weak gravity regime for uniform and non-uniform plasma medium. Importantly, due to the plasma medium, we find that the equations of motions for light obtained from the radiating and infalling/rest gas has to be modified. This in turn, changes and modifies the expression for the intensity observed far away from the black hole. Finally, we have obtained the shadow images for the RGI black hole for different plasma models. Even thought, quantum effect changes the background geometry, these effects are very small and, practically, it is impossible to detect them with the present technology using the supermassive black hole shadows. The parameter $\u03a9$ encodes the quantum effects and, in principle, one expects such quantum effects to play a significant role only for very small black holes. On the other hand, the effect of plasma medium can play important role on the optical appearance of black holes since they effect and modify the equations of motions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in Chinese Physics C","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12949","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-12-27T01:54:39Z","registered":"2022-12-27T01:54:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-02-23T23:00:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We point out that his basic assumption on the additive property of the level-repulsion function $r(S)$ (conditional probability density) in the sense of dividing it linearly into the regular and chaotic part in proportion to the classical fractional phase space volumes $\u03c1_1$ and $\u03c1_2=q$ is not justified, since among other things, it relies on the type of Berry's ergodic assumption, which however is right only in a homogeneous ensemble of ergodic systems, but not in the neighbourhood of an integrable system. Thus his resulting distribution cannot be regarded as a theoretically well founded object. We point out that the semiclassical limiting energy level spacing distribution must be of Berry-Robnik (1984) type, and explain what transitional behaviour of the Brody-type (with fractional power-law energy level repulsion) we observe in the near semiclassical regime where effective $\\hbar$ is not yet small enough. Thus we refer to the derivation, arguments and conclusions in our paper (Prosen and Robnik, J.Phys.A: Math.Gen. 26 (1994) 8059), and explain again the behaviour in this double transition region.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages in LaTeX; two figures available upon request","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/chao-dyn/9706023","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T18:49:40Z","registered":"2022-03-19T18:49:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T18:49:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

By its embedded structure, rTPNN-FES eliminates the utilization of separate algorithms for forecasting and scheduling and generates a schedule that is robust against forecasting errors. This paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm for an IoT-enabled smart home. The evaluation results reveal that rTPNN-FES provides near-optimal scheduling $37.5$ times faster than the optimization while outperforming state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01622","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-07-06T01:55:22Z","registered":"2023-07-06T01:55:22Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-07-07T01:27:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

No narrow iron Kalpha emission line is detected (90% upper limit of equivalent width EW ~40 eV). The nuclear emission flux was observed to remain constant over the observation. A short archival Chandra observation taken in March 2000 further constrains the hard emission to a point source coincident with the radio nucleus. A point source ~3\" southwest of the nucleus does not contribute significantly. Spectral results of the Chandra nuclear source are comparable (within the limited statistics) to the XMM-Newton parameters. The comparison of our iron line upper limit with reported detections indicates variability of the line EW. These results can be explained by the relatively low nuclear absorption of NGC 4258 (which is in the range expected for its intermediate Seyfert type) and some variability of the absorbing material. Reflection components as proposed to explain the large iron line EW of highly absorbed Seyfert 2 galaxies and/or variations in the accretion disk are however imposed by the time variability of the iron line flux.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201267","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T04:59:32Z","registered":"2022-03-19T04:59:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T04:59:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The BubGAN is trained initially on a labeled bubble dataset consisting of ten thousand images. By learning the distribution of these bubbles, the BubGAN can generate more realistic bubbles compared to the conventional models used in the literature. The trained BubGAN is conditioned on bubble feature parameters and has full control of bubble properties in terms of aspect ratio, rotation angle, circularity and edge ratio. A million bubble dataset is pre-generated using the trained BubGAN. One can then assemble realistic bubbly flow images using this dataset and associated image processing tool. These images contain detailed bubble information, therefore do not require additional manual labeling.

In a 1.3-GHz continuum image the remnant appears as a near-circular shell, but with two brightened and distorted arcs of emission on opposite sides. HI absorption against the SNR yields a distance in the range 5.4 to 14.1 kpc, corresponding to an age (1-20)x10^3 yr. On the basis of the SNR's morphology we argue that it is a younger analogue of the W50/SS433 system, and that its unusual appearance is a result of opposed jets or outflows from a central source. A jet-like feature and breaks in the shell can both be seen along the axis of proposed outflow, providing further support for this interpretation; the central source itself is not detected. The SNR may be interacting with the adjacent HII region RCW 80 through an extension of the proposed outflow beyond its shell. This would put the SNR at the lower limit of its distance range and would imply an age &lt;4000 yr. We consider other SNRs similar to G309.2-00.6, and propose remnants whose shells are affected by jets as one of several classes of SNR from which the presence of a central source can be inferred.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 5 embedded eps figures + 2 jpg figures, mn.sty; MNRAS, in press","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805163","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T12:42:45Z","registered":"2022-03-20T12:42:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T12:42:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For more than 100 years, many human mobility prediction models have been proposed, among which the gravity model analogous to Newton's law of gravitation is widely used. Another classical model is the intervening opportunity (IO) model, which indicates that an individual selecting a destination is related to both the destination's opportunities and the intervening opportunities between the origin and the destination. The IO model established from the perspective of individual selection behavior has recently triggered the establishment of many new IO class models. Although these IO class models can achieve accurate prediction at specific spatiotemporal scales, an IO class model that can describe an individual's destination selection behavior at different spatiotemporal scales is still lacking. Here, we develop a universal opportunity model that considers two human behavioral tendencies: one is the exploratory tendency, and the other is the cautious tendency. Our model establishes a new framework in IO class models and covers the classical radiation model and opportunity priority selection model. Furthermore, we use various mobility data to demonstrate our model's predictive ability. The results show that our model can better predict human mobility than previous IO class models. Moreover, this model can help us better understand the underlying mechanism of the individual's destination selection behavior in different types of human mobility.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03701","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T20:39:33Z","registered":"2022-02-26T20:39:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T20:39:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Intensive spectroscopic follow-up observing campaigns targeting stars at different positions on the color-magnitude diagram promises to clarify some of these peculiarities. To able to target cluster members reliably during spectroscopic surveys and both spatial and radial distributions in the cluster outskirts without including field stars, a high quality proper-motion catalog of omega Cen and membership probability determination are required. The only available wide field proper-motion catalog of omega Cen is derived from photographic plates, and only for stars brighter than B~16. Using ESO archive data, we create a new, CCD-based, proper-motion catalog for this cluster, extending to B~20. We used the high precision astrometric software developed specifically for data acquired by WFI@2.2m telescope and presented in the first paper of this series. We achieved a good cluster-field separation with a temporal base-line of only four years. We corrected our photometry for sky-concentration effects. We provide calibrated photometry for UBVRI wide-band data plus narrow-band filter data centered on H_alpha for almost 360 000 stars. We can confirm that the omega Cen metal-poor and the metal-rich components have the same proper motion, and demonstrate that the metal-intermediate component in addition exhibits the same mean motion as the other RGB stars. We provided membership probability determination for published omega Cen variable star catalogs. Our catalog extends the proper-motion measurements to fainter than the cluster turn-off luminosity, and covers a wide area (~33'x33') around the center of omega Cen. Our catalog is now electronically available to the astronomical community.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"21 pages, 15 figures (8 in low resolution), shortened abstract, revised version, accepted (October 3rd, 2008) for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1914","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T16:22:34Z","registered":"2022-03-15T16:22:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T16:22:35Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our framework also allows us to define the embeddedness of an edge, a measure of how strongly an edge features in the weighted cuts of the network.

These posets are characterized by simple conditions defining orthodomains and the additional requirement of having enough directions. Excepting pathologies involving maximal Boolean subalgebras of four elements, it is shown that there is an equivalence between the category of orthoalgebras and the category of orthodomains with enough directions with morphisms suitably defined. Furthermore, we develop a representation of orthodomains with enough directions, and hence of orthoalgebras, as certain hypergraphs.

Here, we argue that, in many cases, the phenomenology of such active states can be efficiently described in terms of fourth- and higher-order partial differential equations. Structural transitions in these models can be interpreted as Landau-type kinematic transitions in Fourier (wavenumber) space, suggesting that microscopically different biological systems can share universal long-wavelength features. This general idea is illustrated through numerical simulations for two classes of continuum models for incompressible active fluids: a Swift-Hohenberg-type scalar field theory, and a minimal vector model that extends the classical Toner-Tu theory and appears to be a promising candidate for the quantitive description of dense bacterial suspensions. We also discuss briefly how microscopic symmetry-breaking mechanisms can enter macroscopic continuum descriptions of collective microbial motion near surfaces and conclude by outlining future applications.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, 6 figures, text extended, App A added, references updated/added","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4464","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T21:52:44Z","registered":"2022-03-11T21:52:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T21:52:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Hence, only few have not been detected with VLBI yet; Fornax A is one of the most famous examples. Here we present the first detection of the compact core region of Fornax A with VLBI. At 8.4 GHz the faint core is consistent with an unresolved point source. We constrained its flux density to be $S_0 = 47.5-62.3\\,\\textrm{mJy}$ and its diameter to be $D^\\textrm{min}_0 \\leq 70\\,\u03bc\\textrm{as}$. The high values of the measured brightness temperature ($T_\\textrm{B} \\gtrsim 10^{11}\\,\\textrm{K}$) imply that the observed radiation is of non-thermal origin, likely associated with the synchrotron emission from the active galactic nucleus. We also investigated the possibility of a second radio source being present within the field of view. Adding a second Gaussian component to the geometrical model-fit does not significantly improve the quality of the fit and we, therefore, conclude that our detection corresponds to the compact core of Fornax A. Analysis of the non-trivial closure phases provides evidence for the detection of more extended flux density, on the angular scale of $\\sim4000\\,\u03bc\\textrm{as}$. Finally, the fractional circular polarisation of the core is consistent with zero, with a conservative upper limit being $m_\\textrm{circ} \\leq 4\\%$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02660","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-06-06T01:52:01Z","registered":"2024-06-06T01:52:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-06-27T01:59:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It has been shown in Kusano et al. (2012) that a small-scale bipolar region (BR), with its flux reversed relative to the potential component of the overlying field, appearing near the polarity inversion line (PIL) is sufficient to effectively trigger a solar flare. In this study we perform further 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the effect that the motion of these small-scale BRs has on the effectiveness of flare triggering. The effect of two small-scale BRs colliding is also simulated. The results indicate that the strength of the triggered flare is dependent on how much of the overlying field is disrupted by the BR. Simulations of linear oscillations of the BR showed that oscillations along the PIL increase the flare strength whilst oscillations across the PIL detract from the flare strength. The flare strength is affected more by larger amplitude oscillations but is relatively insensitive to the frequency of oscillations. In the most extreme case the peak kinetic energy of the flare increased more than threefold compared to a non-oscillating BR. Simulations of torsional oscillations of the BR showed a very small effect on the flare strength. Finally, simulations of colliding BRs showed the generation of much stronger flares as the flares triggered by each individual BR coalesce. These results show that significantly stronger flares can result from motion of the BR along the PIL of a sheared field or from the presence of multiple BRs in the same region.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, Correction made to Equation 1","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05457","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T12:25:26Z","registered":"2022-02-24T12:25:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-06-08T01:19:13Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We have measured accurate physical properties of its components (masses and radii to 1%) and used these to derive the age, metallicity and distance of Cr 228. The rotational velocities of both components of DW Car are high, so we have investigated the performance of double-Gaussian fitting, one- and two-dimensional cross-correlation and spectral disentangling for measuring radial velocities in the presence of strong line blending. Gaussian and cross-correlation analyses require substantial corrections for the effects of line blending, which are only partially successful for cross-correlation. Disentangling is to be preferred because it does not assume anything about the shapes of spectral lines, and is not significantly affected by blending. Complete Stromgren uvby light curves have been obtained and accurate radii have been measured from them using the Wilson-Devinney program, constrained by an accurate spectroscopic light ratio. The Teffs and reddening have been found from Stromgren photometric calibrations. The masses and radii of DW Car are M_A = 11.34 +/- 0.12 Msun, R_A = 4.558 +/- 0.045 Rsun, M_B = 10.63 +/- 0.14 Msun and R_B = 4.297 +/- 0.055 Rsun. The Teffs are Teff_A = 27900 +/- 1000 K and Teff_B = 26500 +/- 1000 K, and the reddening is E(b-y) = 0.18 +/- 0.02 mag. Using empirical bolometric corrections we find a distance modulus of 12.24 +/- 0.12 mag for DW Car, which is in agreement with, and more accurate than, literature values for Cr 228. A comparison between the properties of DW Car and theoretical predictions is undertaken in the mass--radius and mass--Teff diagrams. Good agreement is found for an age of about 6 Myr and a metal abundance of Z approx 0.01 (abridged).","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication by A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610404","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T07:50:47Z","registered":"2022-03-17T07:50:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T07:50:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We obtain these with astrometric data from FGS 3, a white-light interferometer on HST. Utilizing spectrophotometric estimates of the absolute parallaxes of our astrometric reference stars and constraining delta Cep and reference star HD 213307 to belong to the same association (Cep OB6, de Zeeuw et al. 1999), we find pi_{abs} = 3.66 +/- 0.15 mas. The larger than typical astrometric residuals for the nearby astrometric reference star HD 213307 are found to satisfy Keplerian motion with P = 1.07 +/- 0.02 years, a perturbation and period that could be due to a F0V companion ~7 mas distant from and ~4 magnitudes fainter than the primary. Spectral classifications and VRIJHKT$_2$M and DDO51 photometry of the astrometric reference frame surrounding delta Cep indicate that field extinction is high and variable along this line of sight. However the extinction suffered by the reference star nearest (in angular separation and distance) to delta Cep, HD 213307, is lower and nearly the same as for delta Cep. Correcting for color differences, we find = 0.23 +/- 0.03 for delta Cep, hence, an absolute magnitude M_V = -3.47 +/- 0.10. Adopting an average V magnitude, = 15.03 +/- 0.03, for Cepheids with log P = 0.73 in the LMC from Udalski et al. (1999), we find a V-band distance modulus for the LMC, m-M = 18.50 +/- 0.13 or, 18.58 +/- 0.15, where the latter value results from a highly uncertain metallicity correction (Freedman et al. 2001). These agree with our previous RR Lyr HST parallax-based determination of the distance modulus of the LMC.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"To appear in The Astronoomical Journal, September 2002","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0206214","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T02:22:06Z","registered":"2022-03-19T02:22:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T02:22:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It will be shown that Peres' statement is only valid in the large distance or large time limit. In the short distance or short time limit an additional deviation from perfect alignment occurs due to the uncertainty of the location of the source. This error contribution plays a major role in Popper's orginal experimental proposal. Peres' statement applies rather to the phenomenon of optical imaging, which was regarded by him as a verification of his statement. This is because this experiment can in a certain sense be seen as occurring in the large distance limit. We will also reconsider both experiments from the viewpoint of Bohmian mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics particles with exactly opposite momenta will move in opposite directions. In addition it will prove particularly usefull to use Bohmian mechanics because the Bohmian trajectories coincide with the conceptual trajectories drawn by Pittman et al. In this way Bohmian mechanics provides a theoretical basis for these conceptual trajectories.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 3 figures, LaTex, to be published in Found.

In this paper, we propose EmoSphere-TTS, which synthesizes expressive emotional speech by using a spherical emotion vector to control the emotional style and intensity of the synthetic speech. Without any human annotation, we use the arousal, valence, and dominance pseudo-labels to model the complex nature of emotion via a Cartesian-spherical transformation. Furthermore, we propose a dual conditional adversarial network to improve the quality of generated speech by reflecting the multi-aspect characteristics. The experimental results demonstrate the model ability to control emotional style and intensity with high-quality expressive speech.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Proceedings of Interspeech","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07803","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-06-13T01:52:28Z","registered":"2024-06-13T01:52:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-11-06T03:21:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Understanding the response of the detector is imperative in achieving a consistent and well understood energy measurement. The abundance of xenon k-shell x-ray emission during data taking has been identified as a multitool for the characterisation of the fundamental parameters of the gas as well as the equalisation of the response of the detector. The NEXT-DEMO prototype is a ~1.5 kg volume TPC filled with natural xenon. It employs an array of 19 PMTs as an energy plane and of 256 SiPMs as a tracking plane with the TPC light tube and SiPM surfaces being coated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) which acts as a wavelength shifter for the VUV scintillation light produced by xenon. This paper presents the measurement of the properties of the drift of electrons in the TPC, the effects of the EL production region, and the extraction of position dependent correction constants using K$_\u03b1$ X-ray deposits.

When such datasets are too big to be analyzed entirely by a single centralized computer, or when datasets are already stored in distributed database systems, the strategy of divide-and-combine has been the method of choice for scalability. Due to partition, the sub-dataset sample sizes may be uneven and some possibly close to p, which calls for regularization techniques to improve numerical stability. However, there is a lack of clear theoretical justification and practical guidelines to combine results obtained from separate regularized estimators, especially when the final objective is simultaneous inference for a group of regression parameters. In this paper, we develop a strategy to combine bias-corrected lasso-type estimates by using confidence distributions. We show that the resulting combined estimator achieves the same estimation efficiency as that of the maximum likelihood estimator using the centralized data. As demonstrated by simulated and real data examples, our divide-and-combine method yields nearly identical inference as the centralized benchmark.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"This paper is published in Journal of Multivariate Analysis","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06208","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T06:36:36Z","registered":"2022-03-06T06:36:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T06:36:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The first two of these parameters are tightly bound by solar system and gravitational wave propagation experiments, but $\u03bb$ remains relatively unconstrained ($0\\leq\u03bb\\lesssim 0.01-0.1$). We restrict here to the parameter space region defined by $\u03b1=\u03b2=0$ (with $\u03bb$ kept generic), which in a previous paper we showed to be the only one where black hole solutions are non-pathological at the universal horizon, and we focus on possible violations of the strong equivalence principle in systems involving neutron stars. We compute neutron star 'sensitivities', which parametrize violations of the strong equivalence principle at the leading post-Newtonian order, and find that they vanish identically, like in the black hole case, for $\u03b1=\u03b2=0$ and generic $\u03bb\\neq0$. This implies that no violations of the strong equivalence principle (neither in the conservative sector nor in gravitational wave fluxes) can occur at the leading post-Newtonian order in binaries of compact objects, and that data from binary pulsars and gravitational interferometers are unlikely to further constrain $\u03bb$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, no figures.

However, the question of to what optical depth grain alignment still exists in a dense molecular cloud (MC) is unclear. In this paper, we aim to achieve analytical formulae for the minimum size of aligned grains ($a_{\\rm align}$) and rotational disruption ($a_{\\rm disr}$) by RAdiative Torques (RATs) as a function of the local physical parameters within dense MCs. We first find the analytical approximations for the radiation strength and the mean wavelength of the attenuated radiation field in a dense MC without and with embedded stars and then derive analytical formulae for $a_{\\rm align}$ and $a_{\\rm disr}$ as functions of the visual extinction $A_{V}$ and the gas density. We find that within a starless core of density $n_{\\rm H}\\sim 10^{5}\\rm cm^{-3}$, grains of size $a&lt;0.25\u03bcm$ can be aligned up to $A_{V}\\sim 5$ by RATs, whereas micron-sized grains can still be aligned at $A_{V}\\sim 50$. The increase in the alignment size with $A_{V}$ can explain the presence of polarization holes observed toward starless cores. For MCs with an embedded protostar, we find that the efficiency of both alignment and rotational disruption increases toward the protostar due to the increasing radiation strength. Such a disruption effect results in the decrease of the polarization degree with $A_{V}$ or emission intensity, which reproduces the popular polarization holes observed toward the location of protostars. Finally, we derive the formula for the maximum $A_{V}$ where grain alignment still exists in a starless core and discuss its potential for constraining grain growth.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07742","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T01:41:58Z","registered":"2022-02-24T01:41:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T01:41:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

With the development of network embedding, the performance of node classification has been greatly improved. However, nearly all the existing network embedding based methods are hard to capture the actual category features of a node because of the linearly inseparable problem in low-dimensional space; meanwhile they cannot incorporate simultaneously network structure information and node label information into network embedding. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Kernel Supervised Hashing (DKSH) method to learn the hashing representations of nodes for node classification. Specifically, a deep multiple kernel learning is first proposed to map nodes into suitable Hilbert space to deal with linearly inseparable problem. Then, instead of only considering structural similarity between two nodes, a novel similarity matrix is designed to merge both network structure information and node label information.

Specifically, we study the higher bracket -- a generalization of commutator for more than two operators -- of electron density operators in these systems. For topological insulators, we show that the higher-bracket algebraic structure of density operators structurally parallels with the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra (the $W_{1+\\infty}$ algebra), the algebra of electron density operators projected onto the lowest Landau level in the quantum Hall effect. By the bulk-boundary correspondence, the bulk higher-bracket structure mirrors its counterparts at the boundary. Specifically, we show that the density operators of Weyl fermion systems, once normal-ordered with respect to the ground state, their higher bracket acquires a c-number part. This part is an analog of the Schwinger term in the commutator of the fermion current operators. We further identify this part with a cyclic cocycle, which is a topological invariant and an element of Connes' noncommutative geometry.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"28 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09683","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-01-19T02:57:38Z","registered":"2024-01-19T02:57:39Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-01-30T02:52:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Several multimodal fusion methods employing deep learning models are proposed in the literature. Despite their outstanding performance, the complex, opaque and black-box nature of the deep neural nets limits their social acceptance and usability. This has given rise to the quest for model interpretability and explainability, more so in the complex tasks involving multimodal AI methods. This paper extensively reviews the present literature to present a comprehensive survey and commentary on the explainability in multimodal deep neural nets, especially for the vision and language tasks.

This is due to their abundance as well as their small radii and low masses and temperatures, which facilitate the detection of temperate, rocky planets in orbit around them. However, the fundamental properties of M dwarfs are difficult to constrain, often limiting our ability to characterise the planets they host. Here we test several theoretical relationships for M dwarfs by measuring 23 high precision, model-independent masses and radii for M dwarfs in binaries with white dwarfs. We find a large scatter in the radii of these low-mass stars, with 25 per cent having radii consistent with theoretical models while the rest are up to 12 per cent over-inflated. This scatter is seen in both partially- and fully-convective M dwarfs. No clear trend is seen between the over-inflation and age or metallicity, but there are indications that the radii of slowly rotating M dwarfs are more consistent with predictions, albeit with a similar amount of scatter in the measurements compared to more rapidly rotating M dwarfs. The sample of M dwarfs in close binaries with white dwarfs appears indistinguishable from other M dwarf samples, implying that common envelope evolution has a negligible impact on their structure. We conclude that theoretical and empirical mass-radius relationships lack the precision and accuracy required to measure the fundamental parameters of M dwarfs well enough to determine the internal structure and bulk composition of the planets they host.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07780","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T22:55:52Z","registered":"2022-03-01T22:55:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T22:55:53Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This is a purely continuum method that captures reliably the invariance under local and global gauge transformations and does not require a discretisation of space-time. We use it to study a phenomenon that is expected not to be tractable using lattice methods: we show that the 1+1D quantum electrodynamics admits the dynamical horizon violation effect which was recently discovered in the case of the sine-Gordon model. Following a quench of the model, oscillatory long-range correlations develop, manifestly violating the horizon bound. We find that the oscillation frequencies of the out-of-horizon correlations correspond to twice the masses of the mesons of the model suggesting that the effect is mediated through correlated meson pairs. We also report on the cluster violation in the massive version of the model, previously known in the massless Schwinger model. The results presented here reveal a novel nonequilibrium phenomenon in 1+1D quantum electrodynamics and make a first step towards establishing that the horizon violation effect is present in gauge field theory.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9+7 pages, 7 figures.

We observe a double shock-collapse instability: a shock (gradient catastrophe) for the velocity, as well as an annular (ring-shaped) collapse singularity for the density. We find experimental evidence that this instability results from the combined effect of the nonlocal photon-photon interaction and the linear photon losses. The theoretical analysis based on the method of characteristics reveals the main counterintuitive result that dissipation (photon losses) is responsible for an unexpected enhancement of the collapse instability. Detailed analytical modeling makes it possible to evaluate the nonlocality range of the interaction. The nonlocality is controlled by adjusting the atomic vapor temperature and is seen to increase dramatically when the atomic density becomes much larger than one atom per cubic wavelength. Interestingly, such a large range of the nonlocal photon-photon interaction has not been observed in an atomic vapor so far and its microscopic origin is currently unknown.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 6 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06637","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T05:48:29Z","registered":"2022-02-23T05:48:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T05:48:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In order to study the effects of progenitor's rotation and magnetic fields, we compute three models, where the precollapse rotation rate and magnetic fields are included parametrically to a 20 M$_{\\odot}$ star. While we find no shock revival in our two non-magnetized models during our simulation times ($\\sim500$ ms after bounce), the magnetorotationally (MR) driven shock expansion immediately initiates after bounce in our rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized model. We show that the expansion of the MR-driven flows toward the polar directions is predominantly driven by the magnetic pressure, whereas the shock expansion toward the equatorial direction is supported by neutrino heating. Our detailed analysis indicates that the growth of the so-called kink instability may hinder the collimation of jets, resulting in the formation of broader outflows. Furthermore we find a dipole emission of lepton number, only in the MR explosion model, whose asymmetry is consistent with the explosion morphology. Although it is similar to the lepton-number emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA), our analysis shows that the dipole emission occurs not from the protoneutron star convection zone but from above the neutrino sphere indicating that it is not associated with the LESA. We also report several unique neutrino signatures, which are significantly dependent on both the time and the viewing angle, if observed, possibly providing a rich information regarding the onset of the MR-driven explosion.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in the ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02004","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T01:41:25Z","registered":"2022-02-26T01:41:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T01:41:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We report a systematic study on the material dispersion of various optical materials that are capable of supporting quality factors above $10^9$. Using an analytical approximation of WGM resonant frequencies in disk resonators, we investigate the effect of the geometry and transverse mode order on the total group-velocity dispersion ($GVD$). We demonstrate that the major radii and the radial mode indices play an important role in tailoring the $GVD$ of WGM resonators. In particular, our study shows that in WGM disk-resonators, the polar families of modes have very similar $GVD$, while the radial families of modes feature dispersion values that can differ by up to several orders of magnitude. The effect of these giant dispersion shifts are experimentally evidenced in Kerr comb generation with magnesium fluoride. From a more general perspective, this critical feature enables to push the zero-dispersion wavelength of fluorite crystals towards the mid-infrared (mid-IR) range, thereby allowing for efficient Kerr comb generation in that spectral range. We show that barium fluoride is the most interesting crystal in this regard, due to its zero dispersion wavelength ($ZDW$) at $1.93 \\rm{\u03bcm}$ and an optimal dispersion profile in the mid-IR regime. We expect our results to facilitate the design of different platforms for Kerr frequency comb generations in both telecommunication and mid-IR spectral ranges.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02329","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T17:11:24Z","registered":"2022-03-08T17:11:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T17:11:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The data span a predicted time of secondary eclipse, corresponding to the passage of the planet behind the star. In both bands of our observations, we detect a flux decrement with a timing, amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system. This signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e. the observation of photons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. The observed eclipse depths (in units of relative flux) are 0.00066 +/- 0.00013 at 4.5um and 0.00225 +/- 0.00036 at 8.0um. These estimates provide the first observational constraints on models of the thermal emission of hot Jupiters. Assuming that the planet emits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of T_p=1060 +/- 50 K. Under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a Bond albedo of A = 0.31 +/- 0.14. This would imply that the planet absorbs the majority of stellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact to atmospheric models of these objects. We compare our data to a previously-published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predicts prominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbon monoxide. Based on the time of secondary eclipse, we present an upper limit on the orbital eccentricity that is sufficiently small that we conclude that tidal dissipation is unlikely to provide a significant source of energy interior to the planet.(abridged)","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 4 figures, to appear in the Astrophysical Journal, 20 June 2005","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503457","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T01:54:45Z","registered":"2022-03-18T01:54:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T01:54:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Multiple-point statistics are commonly used to generate geo-models. In this paper, a deep-learning-based generative method is developed as an alternative to the traditional Geomodel generation procedure. The generative method comprises two deep-learning models, namely the hierarchical vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE-2) and PixelSNAIL autoregressive model. Based on the principle of neural discrete representation learning, the VQ-VAE-2 learns to massively compress the Geomodels to extract the low-dimensional, discrete latent representation corresponding to each Geomodel. Following that, PixelSNAIL uses the deep autoregressive network to learn the prior distribution of the latent codes. For the purpose of Geomodel generation, PixelSNAIL samples from the newly learned prior distribution of latent codes, and then the decoder of the VQ-VAE-2 converts the newly sampled latent code to a newly constructed geo-model. PixelSNAIL can be used for unconditional or conditional geo-model generation. In an unconditional generation, the generative workflow generates an ensemble of geo-models without any constraint. On the other hand, in the conditional geo-model generation, the generative workflow generates an ensemble of geo-models similar to a user-defined source image, which ultimately facilitates the control and manipulation of the generated geo-models. To better construct the fluvial channels in the geo-models, the perceptual loss is implemented in the VQ-VAE-2 model instead of the traditional mean squared error loss. At a specific compression ratio, the quality of multi-attribute geo-model generation is better than that of single-attribute geo-model generation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02594","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-02-07T02:28:27Z","registered":"2023-02-07T02:28:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-08-23T01:34:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

At the same time, the SM is incomplete, since additional dynamics are required to accommodate cosmological dark matter (DM). In this paper we show that interactions between weak scale DM and the Higgs which are strong enough to yield a thermal relic abundance consistent with observation can easily destabilize the electroweak vacuum or drive the theory into a non-perturbative regime at a low scale. As a consequence, new physics--beyond the DM itself--must enter at a cutoff well below the Planck scale and in some cases as low as O(10 - 1000 TeV), a range relevant to indirect probes of flavor and CP violation. In addition, this cutoff is correlated with the DM mass and scattering cross-section in a parameter space which will be probed experimentally in the near term. Specifically, we consider the SM plus additional spin 0 or 1/2 states with singlet, triplet, or doublet electroweak quantum numbers and quartic or Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson. We derive explicit expressions for the full two-loop RGEs and one-loop threshold corrections for these theories.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"29 pages, 13 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5106","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T22:29:47Z","registered":"2022-03-12T22:29:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T22:29:49Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For 30 years this was attributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (AGN) of low luminosity, making LINER galaxies the largest AGN-sub-population, dominating in numbers over higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies and quasars. This, however, poses a serious problem. While the inferred energy balance is plausible, many LINERs clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an AGN. Using integral field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey, we aim at comparing the observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected from illumination by an AGN. Essential for this analysis is a proper extraction of emission-lines, especially weak lines such as the Balmer Hb line which is superposed on an absorption trough. To accomplish this, we use the GANDALF code which simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines. We show for 48 galaxies with LINER-like emission, that the radial emission-line surface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a central point-source and hence cannot be due to an AGN alone. The most probable explanation for the excess LINER-like emission is ionisation by evolved stars during the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-AGB. This leads us to an entirely new interpretation. Post-AGB stars are ubiquitous and their ionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gas present and stars older than ~1 Gyr, unless a stronger radiation field from young hot stars or an AGN outshines them. This means that galaxies with LINER-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but rather by the absence of a property. It also explains why LINER emission is observed mostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4271","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T18:46:14Z","registered":"2022-03-10T18:46:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T18:46:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We map the Hamiltonian onto a classical $(2+1)$-dimensional XY model with columnar disorder which we analyze by means of large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. For dilutions below the lattice percolation threshold, the system undergoes a generic superfluid-Mott glass transition. In contrast to other quantum phase transitions in disordered systems, its critical behavior is of conventional power-law type with universal (dilution-independent) critical exponents $z=1.52(3)$, $\u03bd=1.16(5)$, $\u03b2/\u03bd= 0.48(2)$, $\u03b3/\u03bd=2.52(4)$, and $\u03b7=-0.52(4)$. These values agree with and improve upon earlier Monte-Carlo results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 015703 (2004)] while (partially) excluding other findings in the literature. As a further test of universality, we also consider a soft-spin version of the classical Hamiltonian. In addition, we study the percolation quantum phase transition across the lattice percolation threshold; its critical behavior is governed by the lattice percolation exponents in agreement with recent theoretical predictions. We relate our results to a general classification of phase transitions in disordered systems, and we briefly discuss experiments.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 12 figures, final version as published","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01860","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T23:38:57Z","registered":"2022-03-05T23:38:58Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T23:38:58Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Current MIR cameras, however, lack in performance and are much less affordable compared to mature Si-based devices, which operate in the visible and near-infrared. Here we demonstrate fast MIR chemical imaging through non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) in a standard Si-based charge-coupled device (CCD). We show that wide-field MIR images can be obtained at 100 ms exposure times using picosecond pulse energies of only a few fJ per pixel through NTA directly on the CCD chip. Because this on-chip approach does not rely on phase-matching, it is alignment-free and does not necessitate complex post-processing of the images. We emphasize the utility of this technique through chemically selective MIR imaging of polymers and biological samples, including MIR videos of moving targets, physical processes and live nematodes.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11487","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T22:24:33Z","registered":"2022-02-25T22:24:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T22:24:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These models allow us to extensively analyze the data obtained from real-world networks, study their relevance and corroborate theoretical results. In this work, we introduce methods, based on degree preserving rewiring, that can be used to tune the clustering and degree-correlations in directed networks with random and scale-free topologies. They provide null-models to investigate the role of the mentioned properties along with their strengths and limitations. We find that in the case of clustering, structural relationships, that are independent of topology and rewiring schemes are revealed, while in the case of degree-correlations, the network topology is found to play an important role in the working of the mechanisms. We also study the effects of link-density on the efficiency of these rewiring mechanisms and find that in the case of clustering, the topology of the network plays an important role in determining how link-density affects the rewiring process, while in the case of degree-correlations, the link-density and topology, play no role for sufficiently large number of rewiring steps. Besides the intended purpose of tuning network properties, the proposed mechanisms can also be used as a tool to reveal structural relationships and topological constraints.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 11 figures, submitted to Physical Review E","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01689","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T16:07:33Z","registered":"2022-03-04T16:07:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T16:07:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The experimental results revealed a high accuracy of the gesture recognition system (99.75%), allowing the user to achieve relatively high precision of the trajectory drawing (mean error of 5.6 cm in comparison to 3.1 cm by mouse drawing) over the three evaluated trajectory patterns.

We combine two probability-based automated spectroscopic and morphological classifications of about 600000 galaxies with z&lt;0.25 to isolate true elliptical galaxies. Our sample selection method does not introduce artificial cuts in the parameters describing the galaxy but instead it associates to every object a weight measuring the probability of being in a given spectro-morphological class. Thus the sample minimizes the selection biases. We show that morphologically defined ellipticals are basically distributed in 3 spectral classes, which dominate at different stellar masses. The bulk of the population (about 50%) is formed by a well defined class of galaxies with old stellar populations that formed their stars at very early epochs in a short episode of star formation. They dominate the scaling relations of elliptical galaxies known from previous works and represent the canonical elliptical class. At the low mass end, we find a population of slightly larger ellipticals, with smaller velocity dispersions at fixed stellar mass, which seem to have experienced a more recent episode of star formation probably triggered by gas-rich minor mergers. The high mass end tends to be dominated by a third spectral class, slightly more metal rich and with more efficient stellar formation than the reference class. This third class contributes to the curvature of the mass-size relation at high masses reported in previous works. Our method is therefore able to isolate typical spectra of elliptical galaxies following different evolutive pathways.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 16 figures.

We show that for all quantum states and all observable-parameter tomography schemes, which includes the reconstructions of arbitrary operator moments and phase-space quasi-distributions, localized sampling with unbalanced homodyning is always tomographically more powerful (gives more accurate estimators) than delocalized sampling with heterodyning. The latter is recently known to often give more accurate parameter reconstructions than conventional marginalized sampling with balanced homodyning. This result also holds for realistic photodetectors with subunit efficiency. With examples from first- through fourth-moment tomography, we demonstrate that unbalanced homodyning can outperform balanced homodyning when heterodyning fails to do so. This new benchmark takes us one step towards optimal continuous-variable tomography with conventional photodetectors and minimal experimental components.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00541","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T20:23:42Z","registered":"2022-03-03T20:23:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T20:23:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We had previously identified these sources as candidates for a sharply inverted integrated radio spectrum whose slope is close to, or even exceeds $\u03b1_c$ = +2.5, the theoretical limit due to synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) in a source of incoherent synchrotron radiation arising from relativistic particles with the canonical (i.e., power-law) energy distribution. We find that four out of the seven candidates have an inverted radio spectrum with a slope close to or exceeding +2.0, while the critical spectral slope $\u03b1_c$ is exceeded in at least one case. These sources, together with another one or two reported in very recent literature, may well be the archetypes of an extremely rare class, from the standpoint of violation of the SSA limit in compact extragalactic radio sources.

The recently discovered pressure-induced superconductor CrAs, as a rare example of a non-collinear helimagnetic superconductor, has therefore generated great interest in understanding microscopic magnetic properties and their interplay with superconductivity [6-8]. Unlike cuprates and iron based superconductors where the magnetic moment direction barely changes upon doping, here we show that CrAs exhibits a spin reorientation from the ab plane to the ac plane, along with an abrupt drop of the magnetic propagation vector at a critical pressure (Pc~0.6 GPa). This magnetic phase transition coincides with the emergence of bulk superconductivity, indicating a direct connection between magnetism and superconductivity. With further increasing pressure, the magnetic order completely disappears near the optimal Tc regime (P~0.94 GPa). Moreover, the Cr magnetic moments between nearest neighbors tend to be aligned antiparallel with increasing pressure toward the optimal superconductivity regime. Our findings suggest that the non-collinear helimagnetic order is strongly coupled to structural and electronic degrees of freedom, and that antiferromagnetic correlations associated with the low magnetic vector phase are crucial for superconductivity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Supplementary Information included","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6615","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T21:38:33Z","registered":"2022-03-09T21:38:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T21:38:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Intersystem crossing in thymine occurs from the $S_1$ ($^1n\u03c0^*$) minimum, via a nearby crossing with $T_2$ ($^3\u03c0\u03c0^*$).

The simulations reveal that, once the system is trapped in the $^1n\u03c0^*$ minimum, intersystem crossing might proceed with a time constant of 1~ps.

The experimentally measured Fermi surface (FS) of RSb consists of at least two concentric hole pockets at the $\u0393$ point and two intersecting electron pockets at the $X$ point. These data agree relatively well with the electronic structure calculations. Detailed photon energy dependence measurements using both synchrotron and laser ARPES systems indicate that there is at least one Fermi surface sheet with strong three-dimensionality centered at the $\u0393$ point. Due to the \"lanthanide contraction\", the unit cell of different rare-earth monoantimonides shrinks when changing rare-earth ion from CeSb to LuSb. This results in the differences in the chemical potentials in these compounds, which is demonstrated by both ARPES measurements and electronic structure calculations. Interestingly, in CeSb, the intersecting electron pockets at the $X$ point seem to be touching the valence bands, forming a four-fold degenerate Dirac-like feature. On the other hand, the remaining rare-earth monoantimonides show significant gaps between the upper and lower bands at the $X$ point. Furthermore, similar to the previously reported results of LaBi, a Dirac-like structure was observed at the $\u0393$ point in YSb, CeSb, and GdSb, compounds showing relatively high magnetoresistance. This Dirac-like structure may contribute to the unusually large magnetoresistance in these compounds.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06237","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T19:35:01Z","registered":"2022-03-04T19:35:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T19:35:02Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For D0-D6 and D0-D8 systems we find special solutions which reduce to the D0-D4 case, giving the same behavior.

Two gamma-ray spectral states are evident and, based on a limited number of contemporaneous X-ray and gamma-ray observations, these states appear to be correlated with X-ray states. The former three objects show hard spectra below 100 keV (photon number indices Gamma &lt; 2) that are exponentially cut off with folding energy ~100 keV, a spectral form that is consistent with thermal Comptonization. This \"breaking gamma-ray state\" is the high-energy extension of the X-ray low, hard state. In this state, the majority of the luminosity is above the X-ray band, carried by photons of energy ~100 keV. The latter four objects exhibit a \"power-law gamma-ray state\" with a relatively soft spectral index (Gamma ~ 2.5-3) and no evidence for a spectral break. For GRO J1655-40, the lower limit on the break energy is 690 keV. GRS 1716-249 exhibits both spectral states, with the power-law state having significantly lower gamma-ray luminosity. The power-law gamma-ray state is associated with the presence of a strong ultrasoft X-ray excess (kT ~ 1 keV), the signature of the X-ray high, soft (or perhaps very high) state. The physical process responsible for the unbroken power law is not well understood, although the spectra are consistent with bulk-motion Comptonization in the convergent accretion flow.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"27 pages, 3 figures, uses aaspp.sty and psfig.sty","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9802242","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T11:54:30Z","registered":"2022-03-20T11:54:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T11:54:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The paper then goes on to develop a general formula for the eigenvalue $c^{(i)}$ of each $C^{(i)}$ valid for any representation of $\\g$, and thereby to relate $c^{(i)}$ to a suitably defined generalised Dynkin index. The form of the formula for $c^{(i)}$ for $su(n)$ is known sufficiently explicitly to make clear some interesting and important features.

Cr$_2$O$_3$ is the prototypical linear ME material, in which an electric (magnetic) field induces a linearly proportional magnetization (polarization), and a single magnetic domain can be selected by annealing in combined magnetic (H) and electric (E) fields. Opposite antiferromagnetic domains have opposite ME responses, and which antiferromagnetic domain corresponds to which sign of response has previously been unclear. We use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the magnetic response of a single antiferromagnetic domain of Cr$_2$O$_3$ to an applied in-plane electric field at 0 K. We find that the domain with nearest neighbor magnetic moments oriented away from (towards) each other has a negative (positive) in-plane ME coefficient, $\u03b1_{\\perp}$, at 0 K. We show that this sign is consistent with all other DFT calculations in the literature that specified the domain orientation, independent of the choice of DFT code or functional, the method used to apply the field, and whether the direct (magnetic field) or inverse (electric field) ME response was calculated. Next, we reanalyze our previously published spherical neutron polarimetry data to determine the antiferromagnetic domain produced by annealing in combined E and H fields oriented along the crystallographic symmetry axis at room temperature. We find that the antiferromagnetic domain with nearest-neighbor magnetic moments oriented away from (towards) each other is produced by annealing in (anti-)parallel E and H fields, corresponding to a positive (negative) axial ME coefficient, $\u03b1_{\\parallel}$, at room temperature. Since $\u03b1_{\\perp}$ at 0 K and $\u03b1_{\\parallel}$ at room temperature are known to be of opposite sign, our computational and experimental results are consistent.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02095","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-09-07T15:00:45Z","registered":"2023-09-07T15:00:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-03-14T02:22:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Recent coherent x-ray speckle experiments on magnetic films have measured the loss of correlation between configurations at opposite fields and at the same field, upon repeated field cycling. We perform finite temperature numerical simulations on these systems that provide a comprehensive explanation for the experimental results. The simulations demonstrate, in accordance with experiments, that the memory of configurations increases with film disorder. We find that non-trivial microscopic differences exist between the zero field spin configuration obtained by starting from a large positive field and the zero field configuration starting at a large negative field. This seemingly paradoxical beahvior is due to the nature of the vector spin dynamics and is also seen in the experiments. For low disorder, there is an instability which causes the spontaneous growth of line-like domains at a critical field, also in accord with experiments. It is this unstable growth, which is highly sensitive to thermal noise, that is responsible for the small correlation between patterns under repeated cycling. The domain patterns, hysteresis loops, and memory properties of our simulated systems match remarkably well with the real experimental systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 10 figures Added comparison of results with cond-mat/0412461 and some more discussion","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0501717","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T22:50:50Z","registered":"2022-03-17T22:50:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T22:50:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We study at what amplitude these wave are subject to instabilities. These instabilities lead to wave breaking whenever the amplitude exceeds a critical value. Below this value, the wave reflects perfectly from the centre of the star. Wave breaking results in spinning up the central regions of the star, and the formation of a critical layer, which acts as an absorbing barrier for ingoing waves. As these waves are absorbed, the star is spun up from the inside out. This results in an important amplitude dependence of the tidal quality factor Q'. If the tidal forcing amplitude exceeds the value required for wave breaking, efficient dissipation results over a continuous range of tidal frequencies, leading to Q' \\approx 10^5 (P/1day)^(8/3), for the current Sun. This varies by less than a factor of 5 throughout the range of G and K type main sequence stars, for a given orbit. We predict fewer giant planets with orbital periods of less than about 2 days around such stars, if they cause breaking at the centre, due to the efficiency of this process. This mechanism would, however, be ineffective in stars with a convective core, such as WASP-18, WASP-12 and OGLE-TR-56, perhaps partly explaining the survival of their close planetary companions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, 10 figures, accepted in MNRAS, abstract shortened (!)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4009","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T18:19:38Z","registered":"2022-03-15T18:19:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T18:19:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We present here an algorithm based on the Kronecker form of a matrix pencil that finds all hidden constraints, for example those associated with derivatives of the equations of motion, and characteristic curves for any 1+1 dimensional system of linear partial differential equations. With the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli decomposition of metric perturbations into angular momentum and parity states, this technique applies to fully 3+1 dimensional perturbations of massive gravity around any isotropic self-accelerating background. Five spin modes of the massive graviton propagate once the constraints are imposed: two spin-2 modes with luminal characteristics present in the massless theory as well as two spin-1 modes and one spin-0 mode. Although the new modes all possess the same - typically spacelike - characteristic curves, the spin-1 modes are parabolic while the spin-0 modes are hyperbolic. The joint system, which remains coupled by non-derivative terms, cannot be solved as a simple Cauchy problem from a single non-characteristic surface. We also illustrate the generality of the algorithm with other cases where derivative constraints reduce the number of propagating degrees of freedom or order of the equations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"27 pages (including 15 pages of appendices), 1 figure","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03423","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T19:11:32Z","registered":"2022-03-06T19:11:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T19:11:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We select a population of 23 075 local disc stars for which complete kinematic data is available. We plot eccentricity against the true anomaly for stellar orbits and identify streams as dense regions of the plot.

Results: We find evidence in 2MASS of a bar of length 4.2 \\pm 0.1 kpc at angle 30 \\pm 10\\degree.

The detailed description of these phenomena is of fundamental importance in order to compare the predictions of theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution with the most recent observations in the infrared region. In this paper we compare the results of GRASIL, a code explicitly solving for the equation of radiative transfer in a dusty medium, with the predictions of a variety of IR template libraries. We employ star formation history samples extracted from the semi-analytical galaxy formation model MORGANA to create libraries of synthetic SEDs from the near- to the far-infrared. We consider model predictions at different redshift ranges to explore any possible influence in the shape and normalization of the SEDs due to the expected evolution of the galaxy properties. We compute the total absorbed starlight predicted by GRASIL at optical wavelengths to statistically compare the synthetic SEDs with the selected IR templates. We show that synthetic SEDs at a given total infrared luminosity are predicted to be systematically different at different redshift and for different properties of the underlying model galaxy. However, we determine spectral regions where the agreement between the results of radiative transfer and IR templates is good in a statistical sense (i.e. in terms of the luminosity functions). Moreover, we highlight some potentially relevant discrepancies between the different approaches, both in the region dominated by PAH emission and at sub-mm wavelengths. These results determine potentially critical issues in the infrared luminosity functions as predicted by semi-analytical models coupled with different IR flux estimators.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages; 7 figures; MNRAS accepted","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0776","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T04:25:53Z","registered":"2022-03-14T04:25:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T04:25:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We consider the scenario with a singlet scalar which gives the heavy neutrino mass and has a small mixing with the SM Higgs boson. We analyze the semileptonic, fully leptonic and mixed $NN$ decay scenarios, and categorize the signal on the number of leptons in the final state: $ \\ell^\\pm \\ell^\\pm$ with at least 3 jets, $\\ell^\\pm \\ell^\\pm \\ell$ with at least 2 jets, and $e^\\pm e^\\pm \u03bc^\\mp \u03bc^\\mp$ plus with at least 1 jet, each containing one or two same-sign dilepton system(s). Selection cuts are optimized for the presence of the associated $Z$-boson, which leads to additional backgrounds at the $e^-e^+$ collider. The Standard Model background channels are systematically analyzed. Sensitivity limits on $h_1 \\rightarrow NN$ branching fractions are derived for signals with 2-4 final leptons assuming the heavy neutrino masses are between 10 and 60 GeV. With 240 GeV center-of-mass energy and 5.6 ab$^{-1}$ design luminosity, $h_1 \\rightarrow NN$ branching fraction can be probed to $2\\times 10^{-4}$ in $2\\ell$ and $3\\ell$ channels, and $6\\times 10^{-4}$ in the $4\\ell$ channel at $95\\%$ confidence level. $3\\ell, 4\\ell$ channels expect one or fewer background event, and their sensitivities saturate the statistic limit at 5.6 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity. A same-sign trilepton ($\\ell^\\pm \\ell^\\pm \\ell^\\pm$) signal in the $3\\ell$ channel is also discussed.

A particular technique for quantum error correction that may be useful for protecting a stream of quantum information is quantum convolutional coding. The encoder for a quantum convolutional code has a representation as a convolutional encoder or as a \"pearl-necklace\" encoder. In the pearl-necklace representation, it has not been particularly clear in the research literature how much quantum memory such an encoder would require for implementation. Here, we offer an algorithm that answers this question. The algorithm first constructs a weighted, directed acyclic graph where each vertex of the graph corresponds to a gate string in the pearl-necklace encoder, and each path through the graph represents a path through non-commuting gates in the encoder. We show that the weight of the longest path through the graph is equal to the minimal amount of memory needed to implement the encoder. A dynamic programming search through this graph determines the longest path. The running time for the construction of the graph and search through it is quadratic in the number of gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 9 figures, Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Computers","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5179","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T08:35:16Z","registered":"2022-03-14T08:35:17Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T08:35:17Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The main new feature is the emission of gravitational waves into the bulk. We study two classes of solutions: First, if the compact dimension is stabilized, the waves vanish and one exactly recovers DGP cosmology. However, a stabilization by means of physical matter is not possible for a tension-dominated brane, thus implying a late time modification of 4D cosmology different from DGP. Second, for a freely expanding compact direction, we find exact attractor solutions with zero 4D Hubble parameter despite the presence of a 4D cosmological constant. The model hence constitutes an explicit example of dynamical degravitation at the full non-linear level. Without stabilization, however, there is no 4D regime and the model is ruled out observationally, as we demonstrate explicitly by comparing to supernova data.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"28 pages, 4 figures; v2: matches version published in JCAP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3328","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T22:53:14Z","registered":"2022-03-08T22:53:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T22:53:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This is more difficult than for Calabi-Yau compactifications, due to the absence of calibrated two-cycles that would have allowed for direct control of W-boson masses as a function of moduli. Instead, we study the relationship between gauge enhancement and singular limits in $G_2$ moduli space where an associative or coassociative submanifold shrinks to zero size; this involves the physics of topological defects and sometimes gives indirect control over particle masses, even though they are not BPS. We show how a lemma of Joyce associates the class of a three-cycle to any $U(1)$ gauge theory in a smooth $G_2$ compactification. If there is an appropriate associative submanifold in this class then in the limit of nonabelian gauge symmetry it may be interpreted as a gauge theory worldvolume and provides the location of the singularities associated with non-abelian gauge or matter fields. We identify a number of gauge enhancement scenarios related to calibrated submanifolds, including Coulomb branches and non-isolated conifolds, and also study examples that realize them.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"41 pages plus references and appendices. v2: references added. v3: JHEP version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05965","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T23:02:06Z","registered":"2022-03-07T23:02:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T23:02:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The von Neumann entropies of \"semi-classical\" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor \"localized\" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another \"boundary structure\" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"83 pages + appendices. v6: to match PRD","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15897","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":5,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-09-29T01:23:44Z","registered":"2023-09-29T01:23:44Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-01-17T02:51:03Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The objective is to create a framework for the automatic identification and tagging of sources according to various criteria (isolated source, partially overlapped, fully overlapped, cross-matched, etc) and to set the basis for the automatic production of the SEDs (spectral energy distributions) for all objects detected in the many multi-wavelength images in cosmological fields.In order to do so, a processing pipeline is designed that combines Voronoi tessellation, Bayesian cross-matching, and active contours to create a graph-based representation of the cross-match probabilities. This pipeline produces a set of SEDs with quality tags suitable for the application of already-proven data mining methods. The pipeline briefly described here is also applicable to other astrophysical scenarios such as star forming regions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"GREAT Workshop.

At the tree-level, this result holds at leading orders in the black holes' velocities and up to quadratic order in their spins. At sub-leading order in black holes' velocities, we demonstrate a matching of the radiation field for quasi-circular orbits in the no-spin limit. At the level of the radiation field, and to leading order in the velocities, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the binary black hole mass and current quadrupole moments, and the scalar and linear-in-spin scattering amplitudes, respectively. Therefore, we show explicitly that waveforms, needed to detect gravitational waves from \\textit{inspiraling} binary black holes, can be derived consistently, to the orders considered, from the classical limit of quantum \\textit{scattering} amplitudes.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"v3: Journal version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12537","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T16:28:50Z","registered":"2022-02-21T16:28:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T16:28:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The latter in particular, however, requires knowledge of the properties of the individual components of the system. Here we present precise optical spectroscopy of the inner companion in the PSR J0337+1715 system. We confirm it as a hot, low-gravity DA white dwarf with Teff=15,800+/-100 K and log(g)=5.82+/-0.05. We also measure an inner mass ratio of 0.1364+/-0.0015, entirely consistent with that inferred from pulsar timing, and a systemic radial velocity of 29.7+/-0.3 km/s. Combined with the mass (0.19751 Msun) determined from pulsar timing, our measurement of the surface gravity implies a radius of 0.091+/-0.005 Rsun; combined further with the effective temperature and extinction, the photometry implies a distance of 1300+/-80 pc. The high temperature of the companion is somewhat puzzling: with current models, it likely requires a recent period of unstable hydrogen burning, and suggests a surprisingly short lifetime for objects at this phase in their evolution. We discuss the implications of these measurements in the context of understanding the PSR J0337+1715 system, as well as of low-mass white dwarfs in general.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"ApJ Letters, in press. 6 pages, two figures. v2 fixes typo","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0407","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T03:23:24Z","registered":"2022-03-10T03:23:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T03:23:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The z &gt; 1 epoch is of particular interest as it was during this time that the volume averaged star formation and the accretion rate of black holes were maximum. Radiatively driven outflows are therefore believed to be common during this epoch. We aim to trace and characterize outflows in AGN hosts with high mass accretion rates at z &gt; 1 using integral field spectroscopy. We obtain spatially-resolved kinematics of the [OIII]5007 line in two targets which reveal the morphology and spatial extension of the outflows. We present J and H+K band SINFONI observations of 5 AGNs at 1.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.2. To maximize the chance of observing radiatively driven outflows, our sample was pre-selected based on peculiar values of the Eddington ratio and the hydrogen column density of the surrounding interstellar medium. We observe high velocity (~600-1900 km/s) and kiloparsec scale extended ionized outflows in at least 3 of our targets, using [OIII]5007 line kinematics tracing the AGN narrow line region. We estimate the total mass of the outflow, the mass outflow rate, and the kinetic power of the outflows based on theoretical models and report on the uncertainties associated with them. We find mass outflow rates of ~1-10 M_sun/yr for the sample presented in this paper. Based on the high star formation rates of the host galaxies, the observed outflow kinetic power and the expected power due to the AGN, we infer that both star formation and AGN radiation could be the dominant source for the outflows. The outflow models suffer from large uncertainties, hence we call for further detailed observations for an accurate determination of the outflow properties to confirm the exact source of these outflows.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08631","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T22:27:30Z","registered":"2022-03-06T22:27:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T22:27:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These applications often demand on-device processing of video streams to deliver real-time, high-quality services for privacy and robustness concerns. However, the performance of these applications is constrained by the raw video streams, which tend to be taken with small-aperture cameras of ubiquitous mobile platforms in dim light. Despite extensive low-light video enhancement solutions, they are unfit for deployment to mobile devices due to their complex models and and ignorance of system dynamics like energy budgets. In this paper, we propose AdaEnlight, an energy-aware low-light video stream enhancement system on mobile devices. It achieves real-time video enhancement with competitive visual quality while allowing runtime behavior adaptation to the platform-imposed dynamic energy budgets. We report extensive experiments on diverse datasets, scenarios, and platforms and demonstrate the superiority of AdaEnlight compared with state-of-the-art low-light image and video enhancement solutions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16135","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-11-30T02:02:30Z","registered":"2022-11-30T02:02:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-12-02T16:41:08Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We then provide an effective Lagrangian independent argument which allows, using information about ordinary QCD, to deduce that the lightest states in super Yang-Mills are the gluinoballs. This helps constraining the Kahler term of the effective Lagrangian. Using this information and the effective Lagrangian we note that there is a small mixing among the gluinoball and glueball states.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"LaTeX, 14 pages + 2 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0408214","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T01:35:15Z","registered":"2022-03-18T01:35:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T01:35:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Recently, the technological development of graphics hardware created a possibility to use desktop video cards to solve numerically intensive problems. We present a powerful parallel computing framework to solve reaction-diffusion equations numerically using the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) with CUDA. Four different reaction-diffusion problems, (i) diffusion of chemically inert compound, (ii) Turing pattern formation, (iii) phase separation in the wake of a moving diffusion front and (iv) air pollution dispersion were solved, and additionally both the Shared method and the Moving Tiles method were tested.

The event originated in a filament channel overlying a circular polarity inversion line (PIL) and occurred on 2013-03-20 during the extended decay phase of the active region designated NOAA 12488/12501. The event was especially well-observed by multiple spacecraft and exhibited the well-studied null-point topology. We analyze all aspects of the eruption using SDO AIA and HMI, STEREO-A EUVI, and SOHO LASCO imagery. One section of the filament undergoes a classic failed eruption with cool plasma subsequently draining onto the section that did not erupt, but a complex structured CME/jet is clearly observed by SOHO LASCO C2 shortly after the failed filament eruption. We describe in detail the slow buildup to eruption, the lack of an obvious trigger, and the immediate reappearance of the filament after the event. The unique mixture of major eruption properties observed during this event places severe constraints on the structure of the filament channel field and, consequently, on the possible eruption mechanism.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09164","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-22T01:36:41Z","registered":"2022-02-22T01:36:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-22T01:36:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Currently mostly on the instrumental side, characterization bottlenecks will soon stand by the models used to translate spectra into atmospheric properties. Limitations stemming from our stellar and atmospheric models have already been highlighted. Here, we show that the current limitations of the opacity models used to decode exoplanet spectra propagate into an accuracy wall at ~0.5-1.0 dex (i.e., 3 to 10x) on the atmospheric properties, which is an order of magnitude above the precision targeted by JWST Cycle 1 programs and needed for, e.g., meaningful C/O-ratio constraints and biosignatures identification. We perform a sensitivity analysis using nine different opacity models and find that most of the retrievals produce harmonious fits owing to compensations in the form of &gt;5$\u03c3$ biases on the derived atmospheric parameters translating in the aforementioned accuracy wall. We suggest a two-tier approach to alleviate this problem involving a new retrieval procedure and guided improvements in opacity data, their standardization and optimal dissemination.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 Pages, 12 Figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07464","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-09-16T01:06:23Z","registered":"2022-09-16T01:06:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-09-16T01:06:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A security policy describes the communication relationship between the networked entities. The security policy defines rules, for example that A can connect to B, which results in a directed graph. However, this policy is often implemented in the network, for example by firewalls, such that A can establish a connection to B and all packets belonging to established connections are allowed. This stateful implementation is usually required for the network's functionality, but it introduces the backflow from B to A, which might contradict the security policy. We derive compliance criteria for a policy and its stateful implementation. In particular, we provide a criterion to verify the lack of side effects in linear time. Algorithms to automatically construct a stateful implementation of security policy rules are presented, which narrows the gap between formalization and real-world implementation. The solution scales to large networks, which is confirmed by a large real-world case study. Its correctness is guaranteed by the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"In Proceedings ESSS 2014, arXiv:1405.0554","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1114","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T03:23:14Z","registered":"2022-03-10T03:23:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T03:23:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Utilizing high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with 2048^3 dark matter particles, 2048^3 gas cells, and 17 billion adaptive rays in a L = 100 Mpc/h box, we show that the density and reionization-redshift fields are highly correlated on large scales (&gt;~ 1 Mpc/h). This correlation can be statistically represented by a scale-dependent linear bias. We construct a parametric function for the bias, which is then used to filter any large-scale density field to derive the corresponding spatially varying reionization-redshift field. The parametric model has three free parameters which can be reduced to one free parameter when we fit the two bias parameters to simulations results. We can differentiate degenerate combinations of the bias parameters by combining results for the global ionization histories and correlation length between ionized regions. Unlike previous semi-analytic models, the evolution of the reionization-redshift field in our model is directly compared cell by cell against simulations and preforms well in all tests. Our model maps the high-resolution, intermediate-volume radiation-hydrodynamic simulations onto lower-resolution, larger-volume N-body simulations (&gt;~ 2 Gpc/h) in order to make mock observations and theoretical predictions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ, comments welcome","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2821","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T18:39:55Z","registered":"2022-03-11T18:39:56Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T18:39:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In addition, the correlation-energy functionals can be partitioned into individual terms that are -- to a varying degree -- universal; yielding, for example, an electron gas approximation. Variational and non-variational energy functionals are introduced that yield the target-state energy when the reference state -- or its corresponding one-particle density matrix -- is constructed from Brueckner orbitals. Using many-body perturbation theory, diagrammatic expansions are given for the non-variational energy-functionals, where the individual diagrams explicitly depend on the one-particle density-matrix. Non-variational energy-functionals yield generalized Hartree--Fock equations involving a non-local correlation-potential and the Hartree--Fock exchange; these equations are obtained by imposing the Brillouin--Brueckner condition. The same equations -- for the most part -- are obtained from variational energy-functionals using functional minimizations, yielding the (kernel of) correlation potential as the functional derivative of correlation-energy functionals. Approximations for the correlation-energy functions are introduced, including a one-particle-density-matrix variant of the local-density approximation (LDA) and a variant of the Lee--Yang--Parr (LYP) functional.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"68 Page, 0 Figures, RevTeX 4, Submitted to Phys.Rev.A (on April 28 2003)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0308056","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T21:25:45Z","registered":"2022-03-18T21:25:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T21:25:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The latter are argued to originate from the anomalous dimension of the corresponding four-quark interpolator. To provide a concrete example, we implement this mechanism into the dilaton soft-wall dual for holographic QCD. Preventing the lowest-lying dual mode from collapsing into the AdS boundary then establishes a rather generic lower bound on the tetraquark mass (which may be overcome in the presence of additional background fields). We further demonstrate that the higher tetraquark excitations can become heavier than their quark-antiquark counterparts and are thus likely to dissolve into the multiparticle continuum.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, 2 figures, vs2 contains a few additional, explanatory comments to match the published version (results and conclusions unchanged)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4341","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T07:55:59Z","registered":"2022-03-14T07:56:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T07:56:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

While most of the systems observed present asymmetric, non-Keplerian accretion discs during outburst, the presence of ordered structures interpreted as spiral density waves is not as ubiquitous as previously anticipated. From a comparison of systems by their system parameters it appears that inclination of the systems may play a major role, favouring the visibility and/or detection of spiral waves in systems seen at high inclination.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"42 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables, 5 appendices","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12089","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T04:35:57Z","registered":"2022-02-27T04:35:58Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T04:35:58Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The WD progenitor evolves in isolation, but its wind during the AGB phase pollutes the companion surface and transfers some angular momentum. Within SHINE survey that uses SPHERE at the VLT, we acquired images of HD2133, HD114174, and CD-567708 and combined this data with high resolution spectra of the primaries, TESS, and literature data. We performed accurate abundance analyses for the MS. We found brighter J and K magnitudes for HD114174B than obtained previously and extended the photometry down to 0.95 micron. Our new data indicate a higher temperature and then shorter cooling age (5.57+/-0.02 Gyr) and larger mass (0.75+/-0.03 Mo) for this WD than previously assumed. This solved the discrepancy previously found with the age of the MS star. The two other WDs are less massive, indicating progenitors of ~1.3 Mo and 1.5-1.8 Mo for HD2133B and CD-56 7708B, respectively. We were able to derive constraints on the orbit for HD114174 and CD-56 7708. The composition of the MS stars agrees fairly well with expectations from pollution by the AGB progenitors of the WDs: HD2133A has a small enrichment of n-capture elements, which is as expected for pollution by an AGB star with a mass &lt;1.5 Mo; CD-56 7708A is a previously unrecognized mild Ba-star, which is expected due to pollution by an AGB star with a mass in the range of 1.5-3.0 Mo; and HD114174 has a very moderate excess of n-capture elements, which is in agreement with the expectation for a massive AGB star to have a mass &gt;3.0 Mo. On the other hand, none of these stars show the excesses of C that are expected to go along with those of n-capture elements. This might be related to the fact that these stars are at the edges of the mass range where we expect nucleosynthesis related to thermal pulses.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted on Astronomy and Astrophysics. 19 pages, 15 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05575","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T23:54:31Z","registered":"2022-02-23T23:54:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T23:54:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The global optimisation method known as adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) is used to minimise the residuals between the observed and simulated Hess diagrams of a star cluster. The simulations are realistic and take the most relevant parameters of young clusters into account. Important features of the simulations are: a normal (Gaussian) differential reddening distribution, a time-decreasing star-formation rate, the unresolved binaries, and the smearing effect produced by photometric uncertainties on Hess diagrams.

We propose that the feedback occurs with the entire cool inner region (5-30 kpc). A moderate cooling flow does exist here, and non-linear over-dense blobs of gas cool fast and are removed from the ICM before experiencing the next major AGN heating event. Some of these blobs may not accrete on the central black hole, but may form stars and cold molecular clouds. We discuss the conditions under which the dense blobs may cool to low temperatures and feed the black hole.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, no figures, to appear in the Proceedings of \"Heating vs. Cooling in Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies\", August 2006, Garching (Germany)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611214","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T22:05:22Z","registered":"2022-03-16T22:05:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T22:05:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

All the tasks that share its description must be performed. Upper and lower bounds on the minimum $\u03c1$-th moment of the number of performed tasks are derived. The case where a sequence of tasks is produced by a source and $n$ tasks are jointly described using $nR$ bits is considered. If $R$ is larger than the R\u00e9nyi entropy rate of the source of order $1/(1+\u03c1)$ (provided it exists), then the $\u03c1$-th moment of the ratio of performed tasks to $n$ can be driven to one as $n$ tends to infinity. If $R$ is smaller than the R\u00e9nyi entropy rate, this moment tends to infinity. The results are generalized to account for the presence of side-information. In this more general setting, the key quantity is a conditional version of R\u00e9nyi entropy that was introduced by Arimoto. For IID sources two additional extensions are solved, one of a rate-distortion flavor and the other where different tasks may have different nonnegative costs. Finally, a divergence that was identified by Sundaresan as a mismatch penalty in the Massey-Arikan guessing problem is shown to play a similar role here.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages; accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory; minor changes in the presentation; added a section on tasks with costs; presented in part at ITW 2013; to be presented in part at ISIT 2014","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6338","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T17:14:02Z","registered":"2022-03-10T17:14:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T17:14:03Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Also, the evolution of the peak fluorescence wavelength provided an indication of the aging of the particles during the day.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 6 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05177","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T22:34:11Z","registered":"2022-03-03T22:34:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T22:34:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the search for dark matter candidates, the QCD axion and axionlike particles (ALPs) have emerged as prominent possibilities. These elusive particles can aggregate into dense structures called axion stars through Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Such axion stars could constitute a significant portion of the mysterious dark matter in the universe. When these axion stars grow beyond a critical mass, usually through processes like accretion or merging, they undergo a self-driven collapse. Traditionally, for spherically symmetric axion clumps, the interaction between axions and photons does not lead to parametric resonance, especially when the QCD axion-photon coupling is at standard levels. Nevertheless, our study indicates that even QCD axion stars with typical coupling values can trigger stimulated decay during their collapse, rather than producing relativistic axions through self-interactions. This process results in short radio bursts, with durations of around 0.1 seconds, and can be potentially observed using radio telescopes like FAST or SKA. Furthermore, we find that collapsing axion stars for ALPs with specific parameters may emit radio bursts lasting just milliseconds with a peak luminosity of $1.60\\times10^{42}\\rm{erg/s}$, matching the characteristics of the observed non-repeating FRBs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 4 figures, updated to match the published version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06860","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-11-14T03:27:20Z","registered":"2023-11-14T03:27:22Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-03-20T02:53:39Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To satisfy strict URLLC requirements for uplink data transmission, the specifications of 5G systems introduce the grant-free channel access method. According to this method, a User Equipment (UE) performs packet transmission without requesting channel resources from a base station (gNB). With the grant-free channel access, the gNB configures the uplink transmission parameters in a long-term time scale. Since the channel quality can significantly change in time and frequency domains, the gNB should select robust transmission parameters to satisfy the URLLC requirements. Many existing studies consider fixed robust uplink transmission parameter selection that allows satisfying the requirements even for UEs with poor channel conditions. However, the more robust transmission parameters are selected, the lower is the network capacity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm that selects the transmission parameters depending on the channel quality based on the signal-to-noise ratio statistics analysis at the gNB. Simulation results obtained with NS-3 show that the algorithm allows meeting the URLLC latency and reliability requirements while reducing the channel resource consumption more than twice in comparison with the fixed transmission parameters selection.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7th International Conference \"Engineering &amp; Telecommunication - En&amp;T-2020\"","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13554","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-23T12:34:26Z","registered":"2022-02-23T12:34:27Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-02-27T08:31:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We analyze each production cross section for $e^+e^- \\rightarrow H^{++} H^{--}$ as a function of a few kinematic variables, which are useful to discuss the creation of the DCHs in the $e^+e^-$ colliders as a signal of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The numerical study shows that the cross sections for creating the lightest DCH can reach values of few pbs. The two other DCHs are too heavy, beyond the observable range of experiments. The lightest DCH may be detected by the International Linear Collider (ILC) or the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) by searching its decay to a same-sign charged lepton pair.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"48 pages, 22 figures, more considerations included, accepted for publication in PTEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5038","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T10:02:36Z","registered":"2022-03-10T10:02:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T10:02:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We first discuss the generalized group-delay approach, then the meaning of the resulting complex visibilities and then demonstrate how coherent integration can be used to perform very precision measurement of stellar properties. For example, we demonstrate how we can measure the diameter of a star to a precision of one part in 350, and measure properties of binary stars. The complex phase is particularly attractive as a data product because it is not biased in the same way as visibility amplitudes.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"SPIE 2008 Astronomical telescopes and instrumentation","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3204","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T07:32:13Z","registered":"2022-03-16T07:32:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T07:32:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

At the contact line regions, a large pressure gradient is generated by the mismatch between the equilibrium contact angle and the apparent contact angle that maintains the viscous flow. It is the conical shape of the substrate that breaks the front/rear droplet symmetry in terms of the apparent contact angle, which is larger at the thicker part of the cone than that at its thinner part.

Simultaneous measurements, avoiding issues related to quasars variability, help us understanding the connection between different Broad Line Region line profiles generally used as virial estimators of Black Holes masses in quasars. The goal of this work is comparing the emission lines from the same object to check on the reliability of H$\u03b1$, MgII and CIV with respect to H$\u03b2$. H$\u03b1$ and MgII linewidths correlate well with H$\u03b2$, while CIV shows a poorer correlation, due to the presence of strong blueshifts and asymmetries in the profile. We compare our sample with the only other two whose spectra were taken with the same instrument and for all examined lines our results are in agreement with the ones obtained with X-shooter at $z \\sim 1.5 - 1.7$. We finally evaluate CIII] as a possible substitute of CIV in the same spectral range and find that its behaviour is more coherent with those of the other lines: we believe that, when a high quality spectrum such as the ones we present is available and a proper modelization with the FeII and FeIII emissions is performed, the use of this line is more appropriate than that of CIV if not corrected for the contamination by non-virialized components.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08046","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T21:11:19Z","registered":"2022-03-04T21:11:20Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T21:11:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The inter-atomic interactions are taken into account in a mean-field approximation (Gross-Pitaevskii equation), leading to a nonlinear three-level model. New eigenstates emerge due to the nonlinearity, depending on the system parameters. Adiabaticity breaks down if such a nonlinear eigenstate disappears when the parameters are varied. The dynamical implications of this loss of adiabaticity are analyzed for two important special cases: A three level Landau-Zener model and the STIRAP scheme. We discuss the emergence of looped levels for an equal-slope Landau-Zener model. The Zener tunneling probability does not tend to zero in the adiabatic limit and shows pronounced oscillations as a function of the velocity of the parameter variation. Furthermore we generalize the STIRAP scheme for adiabatic coherent population transfer between atomic states to the nonlinear case. It is shown that STIRAP breaks down if the nonlinearity exceeds the detuning.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"RevTex4, 7 pages, 11 figures, content extended and title/abstract changed","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0507185","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T22:02:55Z","registered":"2022-03-17T22:02:56Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T22:02:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The model involves a complex scalar field coupled to a gauge and gravity field in the bulk. In earlier work (arXiv:1211.1776) the scalar field had a strong self-coupling, in which case the backreaction on both the metric and the gauge field can be ignored. In this approximation, it was shown that when a time dependent source for the order parameter drives the system across the critical point at a rate slow compared to the initial gap, the dynamics in the critical region is dominated by a zero mode of the bulk scalar, leading to a Kibble-Zurek type scaling function. We show that this mechanism for emergence of scaling behavior continues to hold without any self-coupling in the presence of backreaction of gauge field and gravity. Even though there are no zero modes for the metric and the gauge field, the scalar dynamics induces adiabaticity breakdown leading to scaling. This yields scaling behavior for the time dependence of the charge density and energy momentum tensor.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages; v2 minor corrections; v3 minor corrections, to appear in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7361","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T20:53:07Z","registered":"2022-03-09T20:53:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T20:53:08Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The approach is tailored to deal with angular degrees of freedom, {\\it rotors}, and consists in the iterative solution of a set of deterministic equations with annealing in temperature. The singular short-distance behaviour of the Lennard-Jones potential is adiabatically switched on in order to obtain stable convergence. As testbeds for the approach two distinct ensembles of molecules are used, characterized by a roughly dense-packed ore a more elongated ground state. For the latter, problems are generated from natural frequencies of occurrence of amino acids and phenomenologically determined potential parameters; they seem to represent less disorder than was previously assumed in synthetic protein studies. For the dense-packed problems in particular, the variational algorithm clearly outperforms a gradient descent method in terms of minimal energies. Although it cannot compete with a careful simulating annealing algorithm, the variational approach requires only a tiny fraction of the computer time. Issues and results when applying the method to polyelectrolytes at a finite temperature are also briefly discussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, uuencoded compressed postscript file","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/chem-ph/9502007","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T12:05:34Z","registered":"2022-03-20T12:05:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T12:05:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Two fields, with depths of ~12 hr/pixel over 3 epochs, are analyzed at 3.6 and 4.5 mic. Maps of the fields were assembled using a self-calibration method uniquely suitable for probing faint diffuse backgrounds. Resolved sources were removed from the maps to a magnitude limit of AB mag ~ 25, as indicated by the level of the remaining shot noise. The maps were then Fourier-transformed and their power spectra were evaluated. Instrumental noise was estimated from the time-differenced data, and subtracting this isolates the spatial fluctuations of the actual sky. The power spectra of the source-subtracted fields remain identical (within the observational uncertainties) for the three epochs indicating that zodiacal light contributes negligibly to the fluctuations. Comparing to 8 mic power spectra shows that Galactic cirrus cannot account for the fluctuations. The signal appears isotropically distributed on the sky as required for an extragalactic origin. The CIB fluctuations continue to diverge to &gt; 10 times those of known galaxy populations on angular scales out to &lt; 1 deg. The low shot noise levels remaining in the diffuse maps indicate that the large scale fluctuations arise from the spatial clustering of faint sources well below the confusion noise. The spatial spectrum of these fluctuations is in reasonable agreement with an origin in populations clustered according to the standard cosmological model (LCDM) at epochs coinciding with the first stars era.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"ApJ, to be published","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5617","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T23:24:44Z","registered":"2022-03-12T23:24:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T23:24:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This task is called image compositing. But image compositing is a challenging problem that requires professional editing skills and a considerable amount of time. Not only these professionals are expensive to hire, but the tools (like Adobe Photoshop) used for doing such tasks are also expensive to purchase making the overall task of image compositing difficult for people without this skillset. In this work, we aim to cater to this problem by making composite images look realistic. To achieve this, we are using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS). By training the network with a diverse range of filters applied to the images and special loss functions, the model is able to decode the color histogram of the foreground and background part of the image and also learns to blend the foreground object with the background. The hue and saturation values of the image play an important role as discussed in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses GANs for the task of image compositing. Currently, there is no benchmark dataset available for image compositing. So we created the dataset and will also make the dataset publicly available for benchmarking. Experimental results on this dataset show that our method outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"ESSE 2020: Proceedings of the 2020 European Symposium on Software Engineering","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15446","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T04:07:33Z","registered":"2022-02-23T04:07:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T04:07:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In other words, during migration, the single crystalline texture together with the globally ordered collective motion is preserved even on large length scales. Furthermore, we consider self-propelled particles on a substrate that are surrounded by a thin fluid film. We find that in this case the resulting hydrodynamic interactions can destabilize the order.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 8 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5332","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T15:05:56Z","registered":"2022-03-10T15:05:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T15:05:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The signature schemes that are in use today are based on public-key cryptography and derive their security from computational assumptions. However, it is possible to construct unconditionally secure signature protocols. In particular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature schemes with security based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Several quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has been explicitly generalized to more than three participants, and their security goals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security definitions of Swanson and Stinson (2011) so that they can apply also to the quantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on different verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty signature protocols with information-theoretic security -- quantum or classical -- must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two existing quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security framework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature protocol given in Wallden-Dunjko-Kent-Andersson (2015) to the multiparty case, proving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability. Notably, this protocol can be implemented using any point-to-point quantum key distribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07509","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-03-08T03:24:17Z","registered":"2022-03-08T03:24:19Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-03-15T01:09:26Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The intrinsic \u03c7(T) shows a nearly T-independent behavior below ~ 30 K with a shallow broad maximum at about 16 K, whereas Curie-Weiss-like behavior is observed above 50-100 K. Field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetization M measurements in applied magnetic fields H = 10 to 100 G from 1.8 to 50 K showed no evidence for spin-glass ordering. Crystalline electric field theory for an assumed cubic V point group symmetry is found insufficient to describe the observed temperature variation of the effective magnetic moment. The Kondo and Coqblin-Schrieffer models do not describe the magnitude and T dependence of \u03c7with realistic parameters. In the high T range, fits of \u03c7(T) by the predictions of high temperature series expansion calculations provide estimates of the V-V antiferromagnetic exchange coupling constant J/k_{B} ~ 20 K, g-factor g ~ 2 and the T-independent susceptibility.

The initial grid is designed to be relatively low in parameter resolution and small in occupied hard disk space and therefore can be updated efficiently when a new model is desired. In a pilot study of stellar population synthesis of galaxies, the mean square errors on the estimated parameters are found to decrease with the targeted grid resolution.

The model can be applied to ordinary soliton propagation and to an absorber inside a passively modelocked laser. In the latter case, a comparison with water vapor absorption in a femtosecond Cr:ZnSe laser yields a very good agreement with experiment. Compared to the conventional absorption measurement in a cell of the same length, the signal is increased by an order of magnitude.

Building on recent observational findings of an anti-correlation between the inner disk water luminosity and outer dust disk radius, we aim here at investigating the dynamics of icy solids that drift from the outer disk and sublimate their ice inside the snow line, enriching the water vapor that is observed in the IR. We use a volatile-inclusive disk evolution model to explore a range of conditions (gap location, particle size, disk mass, and alpha-viscosity) under which gaps in the outer disk efficiently block the inward drift of icy solids. We find that inner-disk vapor enrichment is highly sensitive to the location of a disk gap, yielding for each particle size a radial \"sweet spot\" that reduces the inner-disk vapor enrichment to a minimum. For pebbles of 1-10 mm in size, which carry the most mass, this sweet spot is at 7-15 au, suggesting that inner gaps may have a key role in reducing ice delivery to the inner disk and may not allow the formation of Earths and super-Earths. This highlights the importance of observationally determining the presence and properties of inner gaps in disks. Finally, we argue that the inner water vapor abundance can be used as a proxy for estimating the pebble drift efficiency and mass-flux entering the inner disk.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"24 pages, 14 figures; Accepted for publication in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02687","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-20T20:17:04Z","registered":"2022-02-20T20:17:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-20T20:17:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

So, it would be interesting to realize this effective phantom behavior without adopting a phantom field. In this paper we study possible realization of an effective phantom behavior in modified teleparallel gravity. We show that modified teleparallel gravity is able essentially to realize an effective phantom-like behavior in the absence of a phantom field.

Using the time Fourier transform and transforming the problem into the frequency domain, we calculated: (A) the dynamic permeability and (B) the function $F(\u03ba)$ that measures the deviation from Poiseuille flow friction as a function of frequency parameter $\u03ba$. This provides a more complete theory of flow of Maxwell fluid through the longitudinally oscillating cylindrical tube with the oscillating pressure gradient, which has important practical applications. This study has clearly shown transition from dissipative to elastic regime in which sharp enhancements (resonances) of the flow are found.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0107077","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T09:52:39Z","registered":"2022-03-19T09:52:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T09:52:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For (c), we find that over the 10-year period, both the average number of papers per author and the fraction of self citations have been decreasing, but the proportion of distant citations has been increasing. These suggest that the statistics community has become increasingly more collaborative, competitive, and globalized.

Evolutions of these three components are studied and it is found that dark energy dominates before the bounce, and pulls the universe contracting. In this process, dark energy decreases while radiation and the matter increase. After the bounce, the radiation and matter dominates alternatively and then decrease with the expansion of the universe. At present, the dark energy dominates again and pushes the universe accelerating. In this model, we also obtain that the equation of state (EOS) of dark energy at present time is $w_{x0}\\approx -1.05$ and the redshift of the transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion is $z_{T}\\approx 0.37$, which are compatible with the current observations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"ws-ijmpd.cls, 9 pages, 5 figures, final version accepted by IJMPD","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412241","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T00:12:46Z","registered":"2022-03-18T00:12:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T00:12:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This allows us to better assess the possible influence of planet interactions on the chemical composition of stars that are born from the same cloud and thus, should have a similar abundance pattern. In our previous work, we found clear abundance differences for elements with Z$\\leq30$ between both components of this system, and a trend of these abundances as a function of the condensation temperature (T$_{c}$), which suggests a spectral chemical signature related to planet formation. In this work we show that our previous findings are still consistent even if we include more species, like the volatile N and neutron capture elements (Z $&gt;$ 30). We report a slope with T$_{c}$ of $1.56 \\pm 0.24 \\times 10^{-5}$ dex K$^{-1}$, that is good agreement with both our previous work and recent results by Nissen and collaborators. We also performed some tests using ARES and iSpec to automatic measure the equivalent width and found T$_c$ slopes in reasonable agreement with our results as well. In addition, we determine abundances for Li and Be by spectral synthesis, finding that 16 Cyg A is richer not only in Li but also in Be, when compared to its companion. This may be evidence of planet engulfment, indicating that the T$_{c}$ trend found in this binary system may be a chemical signature of planet accretion in the A component, rather than a imprint of the giant planet rocky core formation on 16 Cyg B.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04195","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T20:20:56Z","registered":"2022-02-27T20:20:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T20:20:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The band structure near the Fermi energy, consists of Ru $% t_{2g}$ states hybridized with O $p$ orbitals. The $yz$ and $xz$ bands, which are largely responsible for the nesting related antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ split pairwise into even and odd combinations due to the interlayer coupling reducing the strength of the nesting. The $xy$ bands show much less interplanar coupling as expected, and also less $c$-axis dispersion, so that the barrel like sections are largely intact compared to the single layer material. The zone folding due to orthorhombicity yields small cylindrical lens shaped Fermi surfaces centered at the midpoints of the former tetragonal $\u0393-X$ lines. Fixed spin moment calculations indicate that tetragonal Sr$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ is borderline ferromagnetic but that orthorhombicity favors magnetism via a substantial magnetoelastic coupling.

Two distinct approaches based on inferential and predictive modelling are conducted. While there is some disagreement regarding the relative importance between features, the two approaches largely agree that including institutional information significantly aids the analysis. Both models identify cases where the institutional effects are comparable to factors of known importance such as gender and undergraduate GPA.

Clinical symptoms of dengue virus (DENV) infection range from classical mild dengue fever to severe, life-threatening dengue shock syndrome. However, most DENV infections cause few or no symptoms. Asymptomatic DENV-infected patients provide a unique opportunity to decipher the host immune responses leading to virus elimination without negative impact on t v 'health. We used an integrated approach of transcriptional profiling and immunological analysis comparing a Cambodian population of strictly asymptomatic viremic individuals with clinical dengue patients. Whereas inflammatory pathways and innate immune responses were similar between asymptomatic individuals and clinical dengue patients, expression of proteins related to antigen presentation and subsequent T and B cell activation pathways were differentially regulated, independent of viral load or previous DENV infection. Feedback mechanisms controlled the immune response in asymptomatic viremic individuals as demonstrated by increased activation of T cell apoptosis-related pathways and Fc$\u03b3$RIIB signaling associated with decreased anti-DENV specific antibody concentrations. Taken together, our data illustrate that symptom-free DENV infection in children is determined by increased activation of the adaptive immune compartment and proper control mechanisms leading to elimination of viral infection without excessive immune activation, having implications for novel vaccine development strategies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05692","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T05:40:22Z","registered":"2022-03-03T05:40:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T05:40:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Secondly, we have investigated the packing fraction of the entire Eden cluster including the effect of the interface fluctuation. We find that the entire packing fraction depends on the number of particles while it is independent of the standard deviation, in contrast to the bulk packing fraction. In a similar way to the bulk packing fraction, we have obtained the asymptotic value of the entire packing fraction in the limit $N_{\\mathrm{T}} \\to \\infty$.

In this paper we derive a generalized upper bound on the entropy-to-energy ratio of a $(D+1)$-dimensional system. We consider a box full of entropy lowered towards and then dropped into a $(D+1)$-dimensional black hole in equilibrium with thermal radiation. In the canonical case of three spatial dimensions, it was previously established that due to quantum buoyancy effects the box floats at some neutral point very close to the horizon. We find here that the significance of quantum buoyancy increases dramatically with the number $D$ of spatial dimensions. In particular, we find that the neutral (floating) point of the box lies near the horizon only if its length $b$ is large enough such that $b/b_C&gt;F(D)$, where $b_C$ is the Compton length of the body and $F(D)\\sim D^{D/2}\\gg1$ for $D\\gg1$. A consequence is that quantum buoyancy severely restricts our ability to deduce the universal entropy bound from the generalized second law of thermodynamics in higher-dimensional spacetimes with $D\\gg1$. Nevertheless, we find that the universal entropy bound is always a sufficient condition for operation of the generalized second law in this type of gedanken experiments.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3151","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T04:37:45Z","registered":"2022-03-14T04:37:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T04:37:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Shift current is one of the bulk photovoltaic phenomena related to the Berry phase of the constituting electronic bands: photo-excited carriers coherently shift in real space due to the difference in the Berry connection between the valence and conduction bands. Ferroelectric semiconductors and Weyl semimetals are known to exhibit such nonlinear optical phenomena. Here we consider chalcopyrite semiconductor ZnSnP$_2$ which lacks inversion symmetry and calculate the shift current conductivity. We find that the magnitude of the shift current is comparable to the recently measured values on other ferroelectric semiconductors and an order of magnitude larger than bismuth ferrite. The peak response for both optical and shift current conductivity, which mainly comes from P-3$p$ and Sn-5$p$ orbitals, is several eV above the bandgap.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03376","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T09:43:14Z","registered":"2022-02-27T09:43:15Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T09:43:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These abundances are derived from archival high-resolution ultraviolet spectra from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based optical spectra from several observatories. Ionized Cu and Zn are the majority species, and abundances derived from Cu II and Zn II lines should be largely insensitive to departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We find good agreement between the [Zn/H] ratios derived separately from Zn I and Zn II lines, suggesting that departures from LTE are, at most, minimal (&lt; 0.1 dex). We find that the [Cu/H] ratios derived from Cu II lines are 0.36 +/- 0.06 dex larger than those derived from Cu I lines in the most metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt; -1.8), suggesting that LTE underestimates the Cu abundance derived from Cu I lines. The deviations decrease in more metal-rich stars. Our results validate previous theoretical non-LTE calculations for both Cu and Zn, supporting earlier conclusions that the enhancement of [Zn/Fe] in metal-poor stars is legitimate, and the deficiency of [Cu/Fe] in metal-poor stars may not be as large as previously thought.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal (15 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09763","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T22:12:05Z","registered":"2022-03-02T22:12:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T22:12:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This allows to express refined partition functions of the 20V model in terms of their 6V counterparts, leading to explicit parametric expressions for the various portions of its arctic curve. The latter displays a large variety of shapes depending on the weights and separates a central liquid phase from up to six different frozen phases. A number of numerical simulations are also presented, which highlight the arctic curve phenomenon and corroborate perfectly the analytic predictions of the tangent method. We finally compute the arctic curve of the Quarter-turn symmetric Holey Aztec Domino Tiling (QTHADT) model, a problem closely related to the 20V model and whose asymptotics may be analyzed via a similar tangent method approach. Again results for the QTHADT model are found to be in perfect agreement with our numerical simulations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"68 pages, 37 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06833","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T00:15:03Z","registered":"2022-02-27T00:15:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T00:15:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This statistic can estimate a spatially varying rotation angle. We use this estimator to quantify the prospects of detecting such a rotation field with forthcoming experiments. For PLANCK and CMBPol we find that the estimator containing the product of the E and B components of the polarization field is the most sensitive. The variance of this EB estimator, N(L) is roughly independent of the multipole L, and is only weakly dependent on the instrumental beam. For FWHM of the beam size ~ 5'-50', and instrument noise $\u0394_p ~ 5-50 uK-arcmin, the scaling of variance N(L) can be fitted by a power law N(L)=3.3 x 10^{-7} \u0394^2_p (FWHM)^{1.3} sq-deg. For small instrumental noise \u0394_p \\leq 5 uK-arcmin, the lensing B-modes become important, saturating the variance to ~10^{-6} sq-deg even for an ideal experiment. Upcoming experiments like PLANCK will be able to detect a power spectrum of the rotation angle, C^{\u03b1\u03b1}(L), as small as 0.01 sq-deg, while futuristic experiment like CMBPol will be able to detect rotation angle power spectrum as small as 2.5 x 10^{-5} sq-deg. We discuss the implications of such constraints, both for the various physical effects that can rotate the polarization as photons travel from the last scattering surface as well as for constraints on instrumental systematics that can also lead to a spurious rotation signal. Rotation of the CMB polarization generates B-modes which will act as contamination for the primordial B-modes detection. We discuss an application of our estimator to de-rotate the CMB to increase the sensitivity for the primordial B-modes.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4466","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T14:27:55Z","registered":"2022-03-15T14:27:56Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T14:27:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We find the participant can deduce the other party's private information, which violates the security requirement of private set computation. In order to solve this problem, an improved private set intersection protocol based on Hadamard gate is proposed. Firstly, the more feasible Hadamard gates are used to perform on the original n qubits instead of the quantum Fourier transform, which may reduce the difficulty of implementation. In addition, through the exclusive OR calculation, the participant's private information is randomly chosen and encoded on the additional n qubits, which prevents participants from obtaining the result of the difference set S-diff , and then avoids the internal leakage of private information. Finally, the correctness and security analysis are conducted to show the proposed protocol can guarantee the correctness of computation result as well as resist outside attacks and participant internal attacks.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 1 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11951","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-11-21T03:32:16Z","registered":"2023-11-21T03:32:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-05-14T02:49:49Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The basis set includes all open and closed channels corresponding to exotic-atom states with principal quantum number $n$ from 1 up to 30. Results of these numerical quantum-mechanical calculations of cross sections are used as input data for detailed cascade calculations. The kinetics of atomic cascade for $\u03bc^- p$ and $\u03bc^-d$ atoms is studied in the wide range of the relative target densities, $\u03c6= 10^{-8} -1$ applying the improved version of the cascade model. It is shown that the collision-induced radiative quenching gives a significant contribution to the total disintegration of the $2s$ state of muonic atoms at energies below the $2s-2p$ threshold. The initial population of the $2s$ state for both muonic hydrogen and deuterium atoms, absolute intensities and probabilities of the different disintegration modes as well as their lifetimes are calculated for the fractions with kinetic energies above and below the $2s-2p$ threshold.

In particular, we follow numerically the flavor evolution of neutrino states propagating through a stochastic field of density fluctuations. We examine the approach to neutrino flavor depolarization, and study the effects of this phenomenon in both the early shock reheating epoch and the later r-process nucleosynthesis epoch. Our results suggest that significant fluctuation-induced neutrino flavor depolarization effects occur in these environments only when the zero-order (without density fluctautions) evolution of the neutrino states includes adiabatic propagation through resonances (mass level crossings). In the shock reheating epoch, depolarization effects from fluctuations with amplitudes larger than 0.05% of the local matter density can cause an increase in the heating rate of the material behind the shock compared to the case with no neutrino flavor transformation - but this corresponds to a significant decrease in this quantity relative to the case with adiabatic neutrino transformation. If r-process nucleosynthesis is to occur during the late stages of supernova evolution, then the requirement of neutron-rich conditions excludes a region of neutrino mass-squared difference and vacuum mixing angle ($\u03b4m^2,\\ \\sin^22\u03b8$) parameter space for neutrino flavor transformation.

We utilize photometry in the Hubble Ultradeep Field (HUDF12), Ultraviolet Ultra Deep Field (UVUDF) campaigns and CANDELS/GOODS-S. We estimate SFR, M* from broadband Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) and the best available redshifts. The maximum depth of the HUDF photometry (F160W 29.9 AB, 5 sigma depth) probes the SFR-M* correlation down to M* ~ 10 ^7 Msun, a factor of 10-100X lower in M* than previous studies, and comparable to dwarf galaxies in the local universe. We find the slope of the SFR-M* relationship to be near unity at all redshifts and the normalization to decrease with cosmic time. We find a moderate increase in intrinsic scatter with cosmic time from 0.2 to 0.4 dex across the epoch of peak cosmic star formation. None of our redshift bins show a statistically significant increase in intrinsic scatter at low mass. However, it remains possible that intrinsic scatter increases at low mass on timescales shorter than ~ 100 Myr. Our results are consistent with a picture of gradual and self-similar assembly of galaxies across more than three orders of magnitude in stellar mass from as low as 10^7 Msun.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

We study the the number of events required to discriminate a WIMP signal from an isotropic background for a detector with 2-d read-out using non-parametric circular statistics. We also examine the number of events needed to i) detect a deviation from rotational symmetry, due to flattening of the Milky Way halo and ii) detect a deviation in the mean direction due to a tidal stream. If the senses of the recoils are measured then of order 20-70 events (depending on the plane of the 2-d read out) will be sufficient to reject isotropy of the raw recoil angles at 90% confidence. If the senses can not be measured these number increase by roughly two orders of magnitude (compared with an increase of one order of magnitude for the case of full 3-d read-out). The distributions of the reduced angles, with the (time dependent) direction of solar motion subtracted, are far more anisotropic, however, and if the isotropy tests are applied to these angles then the numbers of events required are similar to the case of 3-d read-out. A deviation from rotational symmetry will only be detectable if the Milky Way halo is significantly flattened. The deviation in the mean direction due to a tidal stream is potentially detectable, however, depending on the density and direction of the stream.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 4 figures, version to appear in Phys.

Method We perform a large scale comparison study where many ensembles constructed from n out of 40 possible valid variants of adjustment methods are applied to eight datasets. The performance of each method was evaluated based on standardized accuracy and effect size. Results: The results have been subjected to statistical significance testing, and show reasonable significant improvements on the predictive performance where ensemble methods are applied. Conclusion: Our conclusions suggest that ensembles of adjustment methods can work well and achieve good performance, even though they are not always superior to single methods. We also recommend constructing ensembles from only linear adjustment methods, as they have shown better performance and were frequently ranked higher.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04568","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T18:17:58Z","registered":"2022-03-04T18:17:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T18:17:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These potentials are crucial for the computation of Hawking radiation and quasi-normal modes emitted by black holes. In addition to the Schwarzschild metric, we apply these results and give the explicit formulas for the radial potentials in the case of charged (Reissner--Nordstr\u00f6m) black holes, higher-dimensional black holes, and polymerized black holes arising from loop quantum gravity. These results are in particular relevant and applicable to a large class of regular black hole metrics.

Intuitively, unstretchability is captured by a constraint on the metric within the bulk. Naively one would then guess that this constraint is enough to ensure that the deformations determining the boundary conditions on these edges respect the isometry constraint. If matters were this simple, unfortunately, it would imply unbalanced torques (as well as forces) along the edge unless manifestly unphysical constraints are met by the boundary geometry. In this paper we identify the source of the problem: not only the local arc-length but also the geodesic curvature need to be constrained explicitly on all free edges. We derive the boundary conditions which follow. Contrary to conventional wisdom, there is no need to introduce boundary layers. This framework is applied to isolated conical defects, both with deficit as well, but more briefly, as surplus angles. Using these boundary conditions, we show that the lateral tension within a circular cone of fixed radius is equal but opposite to the radial compression, and independent of the deficit angle itself. We proceed to examine the effect of an oblique outer edge on this cone perturbatively demonstrating that both the correction to the geometry as well as the stress distribution in the cone kicks in at second order in the eccentricity of the edge.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05855","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T07:01:16Z","registered":"2022-02-28T07:01:17Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T07:01:17Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

All these observations suggest that the strategies with single step memory of the individuals can never collectively achieve full utilization ($f = 1$) in finite convergence time and perhaps the maximum possible utilization that can be achieved is about eighty percent ($f \\simeq 0.80$) in an optimal time $\u03c4$ of order ten, even when $N$ the number of customers or of the restaurants goes to infinity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 6 figures included in manuscript; Accepted for publication in Indian Journal of Physics","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05705","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-11-13T02:04:41Z","registered":"2023-11-13T02:04:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-02-16T02:52:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The decrease of the inclination angle between between the spin axis and the magnetic axis can be responsible for such a high braking index. However, the physical mechanisms causing the change of the magnetic inclination angle have not been fully understood. In this Letter, we apply a two-dipole model given by Hamil et al (2016) to explain the decrease of the magnetic inclination angle of PSR J1640-4631. The rotation effect of a charged sphere and the magnetization of ferromagnetically ordered material produce magnetic moments $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, respectively. There exist a minimum of the potential energy for the magnetic moment $M_{2}$ in the magnetic field of $M_{1}$, hence the $M_{2}$ will freely rotate around the minimum energy position (i. e equilibrium position), similar to a simple pendulum. Our calculation indicate the magnetic moment $M_{2}$ would evolve towards alignment with the spin axis for PSR J1640-4631, and cause the magnetic inclination angle to decrease. The single peak in the pulse profile favors a relatively low change rate of the magnetic inclination angle.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 2 figures, PASJ in press","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01699","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T03:19:37Z","registered":"2022-02-27T03:19:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T03:19:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The mass spectrum of scalar particles is determined analytically (in the WKB approximation) and numerically in the whole two-dimensional parameter space. We compare the mass spectrum with analogous results from lattice calculations, and find that the supergravity predictions are close to the lattice results everywhere on the two dimensional parameter space except along a special line. We also examine the mass spectrum of the supergravity Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes and find that the KK modes along the compact D-brane coordinate decouple from the spectrum for large angular momenta.

The eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of the band edge states are calculated as a function of an external magnetic field with the electromagnetic field incorporated into the tight-binding Hamiltonian in a gauge-invariant form. The spin-orbit interaction and magnetic field are treated non-perturbatively. The g-factors are extracted from the energy splitting of the eigenstates induced by the applied magnetic field. Both electron and hole g-factors are investigated for CdSe nanostructures. The size and aspect ratio dependence of g-factors is studied. We observe that the electron g-factors are anisotropic and find that the calculated values agree quantitatively with experimental data. We conclude that the two distinct g-factor values extracted from time resolved Faraday rotation experiments should be assigned to the anisotropic in plane ($g_\\parallel$) and out of plane ($g_z$) electron g-factors, rather than to isotropic electron and exciton g-factors. We find that the anisotropy in the electron g-factor depends on the aspect ratio of the nanocrystal. The g-factor anisotropy derived from the wurtzite structure and from the non-unity aspect ratio may cancel each other in some regime. We observe that hole g-factors oscillate as a function of size, due to size dependent mixing between the heavy hole-light hole components of the valence band edge states. Extension to the calculation of exciton g-factors is discussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to Phys. Rev.

We use lattice Monte Carlo methods to determine essential quantities like the energy, which we compute as a function of coupling strength and particle number in the regime from few to many particles. Many-fermion systems bound by hard walls display non-trivial density profiles characterized by so-called Friedel oscillations (which are similar to those observed in harmonic traps). In non-interacting systems, the characteristic length scale of the oscillations is set by (2 kF)^(-1), where kF is the Fermi momentum, while repulsive interactions tend to generate Wigner-crystal oscillations of period (4 kF)^(-1). Based on the non-interacting result, we find a remarkably simple parametrization of the density profiles of the attractively interacting case, which we generalize to the one-body density matrix. While the total momentum is not a conserved quantity in the presence of hard walls, the magnitude of the momentum does provide a good quantum number. We are therefore able to provide a detailed characterization of the (quasi-)momentum distribution, which displays rather robust discontinuity at the Fermi surface. In addition, we determine the spatially varying on-site density-density correlation, which in turn yields Tan's contact density and, upon integration, Tan's contact. As is well known, the latter fully determines the short-range correlations and plays a crucial role in a multitude of equilibrium and non-equilibrium sum rules.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 8 figures.

may consist of particles beyond the Standard Model that are still elusive to experiments. Among indirect search techniques, which look for stable products from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles, or from axions coupling to high-energy photons, observations of the $\u03b3$-ray sky have come to prominence over the last few years, because of the excellent sensitivity of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope mission. The LAT energy range from 20 MeV to above 300 GeV is particularly well suited for searching for products of the interactions of dark matter particles. In this report we describe methods used to search for evidence of dark matter with the LAT, and review the status of searches performed with up to six years of LAT data. We also discuss the factors that determine the sensitivities of these searches, including the magnitudes of the signals and the relevant backgrounds, considering both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We project the expected sensitivities of each search method for 10 and 15 years of LAT data taking. In particular, we find that the sensitivity of searches targeting dwarf galaxies, which provide the best limits currently, will improve faster than the square root of observing time. Current LAT limits for dwarf galaxies using six years of data reach the thermal relic level for masses up to 120 GeV for the $b\\bar{b}$ annihilation channel for reasonable dark matter density profiles. With projected discoveries of additional dwarfs, these limits could extend to about 250 GeV. With as much as 15 years of LAT data these searches would be sensitive to dark matter annihilations at the thermal relic cross section for masses to greater than 400 GeV (200 GeV) in the $b\\bar{b}$ ($\u03c4^+ \u03c4^-$) annihilation channels.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Updated with a few additional and corrected references; otherwise, text is identical to previous version.

However, this is not always true. We present a new class of {\\it % codimension-one} solitons (i.e., those existing at isolated frequency values) that are {\\em embedded} into the continuous spectrum. This is possible if the spectrum of the linearized system has (at least) two branches, one corresponding to exponentially localized solutions, and the other to radiation modes. An embedded soliton (ES) is obtained when the latter component exactly vanishes in the solitary-wave's tail. The paper contains both a survey of recent results obtained by the authors and some new results, the aim being to draw together several different mechanism underlying the existence of ESs. We also consider the distinctive property of {\\em semi-stability} of ES, and {\\em moving} ESs. Results are presented for four different physical models, including an extended 5th-order KdV equation describing surface waves in inviscid fluids, and three models from nonlinear optics. One of them pertains to a resonant Bragg grating in an optical fiber with a cubic nonlinearity, while two others describe second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the temporal or spatial domain (i.e., respectively, propagating pulses in nonlinear optical fibers, or stationary patterns in nonlinear planar waveguides). Special attention is paid to the SHG model in the temporal domain for a case of competing quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. An essential new result is that ES is, virtually, fully stable in the latter model in the case when both harmonics have anomalous dispersion.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"To appear in a special issue of Physica D; Proceedings of a meeting devoted to the 60th birthday of V.E.

In this paper, we update this correlation with the data collected until June 2014, expanding the sample size with $\\sim$35% more objects, where the number of short GRBs doubled. With this larger sample we confirm the existence of a universal correlation that connects the prompt and afterglow properties of long and short GRBs. We show that this correlation does not depend on the X-ray light-curve morphology and that further analysis is necessary to firmly exclude possible biases derived by redshift measurements. In addition we discuss about the behavior of the peculiar objects as ultra-long GRBs and we propose the existence of an intermediate group between long and short GRBs. Interestingly, two GRBs with uncertain classification fall into this category. Finally, we discuss the physics underlying this correlation, in the contest of the efficiency of conversion of the prompt $\u03b3$-ray emission energy into the kinetic energy of the afterglow, the photosferic model, and the cannonball model.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05673","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T17:10:02Z","registered":"2022-03-07T17:10:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T17:10:03Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This muon puzzle hampers a precise determination of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray mass composition. We investigate the potential of producing states of dense quark-gluon matter (which we call fireballs) to resolve the muon puzzle as quantified with data from the Pierre Auger Observatory on the depth of the shower maximum and the number of muons at ground. Adopting a phenomenological fireball model, we find that the inelasticity enhancement associated with the formation of a plasma state is in tension with data on the electromagnetic longitudinal shower development. Instead, we restrict the fireball model to only enhance the strangeness produced in Standard Model hadronic interactions, and dub this model the strangeball model. With an analytic approach based on the Heitler-Matthews model we then find explicit sets of strangeball parameters that resolve the muon puzzle. Constraints from data on shower-to-shower fluctuations of the muon number require strangeness enhancements already at energies accessible to current-generation collider experiments. At Tevatron and LHC energies we estimate 40% of the interactions to produce strangeballs, corresponding to a 5-9% increase of the average fraction of energy retained in the hadronic cascade compared to predictions from current hadronic interaction models. A comparison with relevant measurements of the LHCf and LHCb detectors does not directly exclude this scenario, though the obtained tension with LHCb suggests a stringent test at 14 TeV.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"This is the Accepted Manuscript version of an article accepted for publication in Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.

We further demonstrate that when a zero temperature type I fracton model is placed in contact with a finite temperature heat bath, the approach to equilibrium is a logarithmic function of time over an exponentially wide window of time scales. Generalizing to the more complex \"type II\" fracton models, we find that the charges exhibit subdiffusion upto a relaxation time that diverges at low temperatures as a super-exponential function of inverse temperature. This behaviour is reminiscent of \"nearly localized\" disordered systems, but occurs with a translation invariant three-dimensional Hamiltonian.

For this reason, we carry out an experimental study of fully turbulent flows of a yield stress fluid in a rectangular aspect ratio channel with a high-resolution laser doppler velocimetry (LDA) setup. We employ aqueous Carbopol solutions, often considered to be a simple yield stress fluid. We formulate different concentrations to address the effect of the rheology of the fluid on the turbulence statistics at an approximately constant Reynolds number. Additionally, we also perform experiments with a single Carbopol formulation at different Reynolds numbers to study its effect. The flow analysis is performed via rheology measurements, turbulence statistics and power spectral densities of velocity fluctuations. The addition of Carbopol to the flow increases turbulence anisotropy, with an enhancement of streamwise velocity fluctuations and a decrease in wall normal velocity fluctuations in comparison to water at the same mean velocity. This change is reflected on the power spectral densities of streamwise velocity fluctuations, where we observe a large increase in energy of large scale turbulent structures. Conversely, the energy of smaller scales is decreased in comparison to water, where the energy drops with a steeper scale than the Newtonian power law of $k_x^{-5/3}$. As we increase the Reynolds number with a Carbopol solution, the streamwise Reynolds stresses approach Newtonian values in the core, which suggests diminishing effects of shear-thinning. The power spectral densities reveal that the energy content at larger scales decreases slightly with the Reynolds number. However, the shear thinning effects do not disappear even as the Reynolds number approaches 50000.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08404","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-07-19T01:42:27Z","registered":"2022-07-19T01:42:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-07-19T01:42:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, real world scenes have multiple illuminants, like sunlight and spot lights all together in one scene. We present in this paper a simple yet very effective framework using a deep CNN-based method to estimate and use multiple illuminants for colour constancy. Our approach works well in both the multi and single illuminant cases.

In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially LSTMs and transformers, have been greatly successful in the field of energy consumption forecasting. Nevertheless, these techniques have difficulties in capturing complex and sudden variations, and, moreover, they are commonly examined only on a specific type of consumer (e.g., only offices, only schools). Consequently, this paper proposes HyperEnergy, a consumer energy forecasting strategy that leverages hypernetworks for improved modeling of complex patterns applicable across a diversity of consumers. Hypernetwork is responsible for predicting the parameters of the primary prediction network, in our case LSTM. A learnable adaptable kernel, comprised of polynomial and radial basis function kernels, is incorporated to enhance performance. The proposed HyperEnergy was evaluated on diverse consumers including, student residences, detached homes, a home with electric vehicle charging, and a townhouse. Across all consumer types, HyperEnergy consistently outperformed 10 other techniques, including state-of-the-art models such as LSTM, AttentionLSTM, and transformer.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05104","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2025-02-10T03:00:28Z","registered":"2025-02-10T03:00:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-02-10T03:00:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We have identified three major classes: a) an incomplete log-normal shape, truncated on the left side, for the less developed countries, b) a complete log-normal, with a wider range of volumes, for nations characterized by intermediate economy, and c) a strongly asymmetric shape for countries with a high degree of development. The ranking curves of the exported volumes from each country seldom cross each other, showing a clear hierarchy of export volumes. Finally, the log-normality hypothesis has been checked for the distributions of all the 148 countries through different tests, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-Von Mises, confirming that it cannot be rejected only for the countries of intermediate economy.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IWcee15 conference","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03597","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T16:29:35Z","registered":"2022-03-07T16:29:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T16:29:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Functionality such as data binding , object-relational mapping and user interface builders can be heavily dependent on these features. However, their use has risks and downsides as they affect the soundness of static analyses and techniques that rely on such analyses (such as bug detection and automated program repair). They can also make software more error-prone due to potential difficulties in understanding reflective code, loss of compile-time safety and incorrect API usage. In this paper, we set out to quantify some of the effects of using dynamic language features in Java programs-that is, the error-proneness of using those features with respect to a particular type of bug known as single statement bugs. By mining 2,024 GitHub projects, we found 139 single statement bug instances (falling under 10 different bug patterns), with the highest number of bugs belonging to three specific patterns: Wrong Function Name, Same Function More Args and Change Identifier Used. These results can help practitioners to quantify the risk of using dynamic techniques over alternatives (such as code generation). We hope this classification raises attention on choosing dynamic APIs that are likely to be error-prone, and provides developers a better understanding when designing bug detection tools for such feature.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted at the 30th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2022) - ERA track","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00963","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-04-05T02:06:35Z","registered":"2022-04-05T02:06:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-04-05T02:06:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Both rate-dependent upscaling and upscaling in the capillary and viscous limits are considered. In particular, we study fluvial depositional systems, which represent a large and important class of reservoirs. Numerical examples show that steady-state upscaling is rate dependent, in accordance with previous work. In this respect we introduce a scale-dependent capillary number to estimate the balance between viscous and capillary forces. The difference between the limit solutions can be large, and we show that the intermediate flow rates can span several orders of magnitude. This substantiate the need for rate-dependent steady-state upscaling in a range of flow scenarios. We demonstrate that steady-state upscaling converges from the capillary to the viscous limit solution as the flow rate increases, and we identify a simple synthetic model where the convergence fails to be monotone. Two different sets of boundary conditions were tested, but had only minor effects on the presented reservoir models. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of steady-state upscaling by performing dynamic flow simulation at the reservoir scale, both on fine-scaled and on upscaled models. The considered model is viscous dominated for realistic flow rates, and the simulation results indicate that viscous limit upscaling is appropriate.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09743","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T02:12:39Z","registered":"2022-03-04T02:12:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T02:12:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To elucidate intrinsic noise, several modeling strategies such as the Gillespie algorithm have been used successfully. This paper contributes an approach as an alternative to these classical settings. Within the discrete paradigm, where genes, proteins, and other molecular components of gene regulatory networks are modeled as discrete variables and are assigned as logical rules describing their regulation through interactions with other components. Stochasticity is modeled at the biological function level under the assumption that even if the expression levels of the input nodes of an update rule guarantee activation or degradation there is a probability that the process will not occur due to stochastic effects. This approach allows a finer analysis of discrete models and provides a natural setup for cell population simulations to study cell-to-cell variability. We applied our methods to two of the most studied regulatory networks, the outcome of lambda phage infection of bacteria and the p53-mdm2 complex.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages, 8 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5578","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T23:13:29Z","registered":"2022-03-12T23:13:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T23:13:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We present the friction force and breakdown fields Ek in various N2:O2 (Earth-like) and N2:CH4 (Titan-like) mixtures. The strength of the friction force is larger in N2:CH4 mixtures whereas the breakdown field in mixtures with methane is half as large as in mixtures with oxygen. We use a 2.5 dimensional Monte Carlo particle-in-cell code with cylindrical symmetry to simulate the development of electron avalanches from an initial electron-ion patch in ambient electric fields between 1.5Ek and 3Ek. We compare the electron density, the electric field, the front velocities as well as the occurrence of avalanche-to-streamer transition between mixtures with methane and with oxygen. Whereas we observe the formation of streamers in oxygen in all considered cases, we observe streamer inceptions in methane for small percentages of nitrogen or for large electric fields only. For large percentages of nitrogen or for small fields, ionization is not efficient enough to form a streamer channel within the length of the simulation domain. In oxygen, positive and negative streamers move faster for small percentages of nitrogen. In mixtures with methane, electron or streamer fronts move 10-100 times slower than in mixtures with oxygen; the higher the percentage of methane, the faster the fronts move.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"34 pages, 11 figures, 1 table","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09906","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T02:24:23Z","registered":"2022-03-03T02:24:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T02:24:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

They are remarkably powerful in the link prediction and knowledge base completion tasks, mainly due to the learned representations that capture important statistical dependencies in the data. Recent works in the area have focused on either designing new scoring functions or incorporating extra information into the learning process to improve the representations. Yet the representations are mostly learned from the observed links between entities, ignoring commonsense or schema knowledge associated with the relations in the graph. A fundamental aspect of the topology of relational data is the cardinality information, which bounds the number of predictions given for a relation between a minimum and maximum frequency. In this paper, we propose a new regularisation approach to incorporate relation cardinality constraints to any existing neural link predictor without affecting their efficiency or scalability. Our regularisation term aims to impose boundaries on the number of predictions with high probability, thus, structuring the embeddings space to respect commonsense cardinality assumptions resulting in better representations. Experimental results on Freebase, WordNet and YAGO show that, given suitable prior knowledge, the proposed method positively impacts the predictive accuracy of downstream link prediction tasks.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, accepted at the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC '19)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06455","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T06:29:05Z","registered":"2022-03-01T06:29:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T06:29:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The X-ray pulse profile resembles the modulation of hot spot on the surface of the neutron star. The phase-averaged spectral analysis also suggests that the majority of the observed X-rays have a thermal origin.

We construct a model based on unimodular gravity to show how this can be accomplished within the framework of flat space-time. We show that the model predicts the Hubble law if the masses increase with time. Furthermore we show that it fits the high z supernova data in a manner almost identical to the standard Big Bang model. Furthermore we show that at early times the Universe is dominated by radiative energy density. The phenomenon of recombination also arises in our model and hence predicts the existence of CMBR. However a major difference with the standard Big Bang is that the radiative temperature and energy density does not evolve in our model. Furthermore we argue that the basic motivation for inflation is absent in our model.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, no figures, changes in presentation","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2314","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T22:46:30Z","registered":"2022-03-11T22:46:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T22:46:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here we study the LG dynamics in the context of Extended Theories of Gravity like $f(R)$ gravity considered as dark energy and dark matter contributions. In the first approach, we perturb the dark energy effect considering a Yukawa-like interaction that naturally emerges from $f(R)$ gravity in the weak field limit. We assume the mass of LG from simulations and, from this, derive constraints on the Yukawa couplings: $\u03b1&lt; 0.581$ and $m_{grav} &lt; 5.095 \\cdot 10^{-26} \\, eV/c^2$. In the second part, considering a minimal extension of General Relativity, i.e. $f(R) \\sim R^{1+\u03b5}$, with $|\u03b5|\\ll 1$, we investigate the possibility that it replaces dark matter as a MOND-like theory. We find that there is a value of the parameter $\u03b2$ (derived starting from $\u03b5$) which gives a minimal value for the LG mass. Moreover, this particular potential allows to calculate the ratio of dark matter and baryonic matter for the LG to be.

This paper describes a method for understanding the influence one variable exerts on another in such models as a force, with the relative effects of these forces providing a narrative explanation of the curvature in variable behaviour. Using the stock/flow form of a model, a symbolic notation is developed that identifies the forces with the causal pathways of the model's feedback loops. A force is measured by its impact, defined as the ratio of acceleration to rate of change, computed by differentiation along its associated pathway between variables. Different phases of force dominance are determined to enhance the standard stability analysis of the models, providing an explanation of model behaviour in Newtonian mechanical terms. The concepts developed are applied to well-known models from mathematical biology: the Spruce Budworm model, where force dominance identifies scenarios that give clarity to intervention points; and the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model where the analysis highlights the importance of dissipative forces in achieving stability. Conclusions are drawn on the explanatory power of this approach, with suggestions made for future work.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages, 16 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04252","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T02:32:33Z","registered":"2022-03-09T02:32:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T02:32:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

During the brightest stage of the outbursts from this source, the lags increase in magnitude as the accretion rate drops; when the outbursts enter their dimmer flaring-tail stage, the relationship reverses. We evaluate this complex dependence in the context of two theoretical models for the lags, one relying on the scattering of photons by the accretion disk and the other invoking a two-component model for the photon emission.

With the proposed formulation, the nodes in the network are regarded as players and the local combiner of estimation information from different neighbors is regarded as different strategies selection. We show that this graphical evolutionary game framework is very general and can unify the existing adaptive network algorithms. Based on this framework, as examples, we further propose two error-aware adaptive filtering algorithms. Moreover, we use graphical evolutionary game theory to analyze the information diffusion process over the adaptive networks and evolutionarily stable strategy of the system.

SIFS junctions have gained considerable interest in recent years because they show a number of interesting properties for future classical and quantum computing devices. We optimized the fabrication process of these junctions to achieve a homogeneous current transport, ending up with high-quality samples. Depending on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer and on temperature, the SIFS junctions are in the ground state with a phase drop either 0 or $\u03c0$. By using a ferromagnetic layer with variable step-like thickness along the junction, we obtained a so-called 0-$\u03c0$ Josephson junction, in which 0 and $\u03c0$ ground states compete with each other. At a certain temperature the 0 and $\u03c0$ parts of the junction are perfectly symmetric, i.e. the absolute critical current densities are equal. In this case the degenerate ground state corresponds to a vortex of supercurrent circulating clock- or counterclockwise and creating a magnetic flux which carries a fraction of the magnetic flux quantum $\u03a6_0$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0701693","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T13:30:01Z","registered":"2022-03-16T13:30:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T02:42:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is found that the rectification increases when the number of particles in each polymer, as well as its length, increases. In addition, the rectification increases when the size of the opening between neighboring funnel tips, lo, decreases. Interestingly, if the conformal entropic difference exceeds the thermal diffusion, net directed motion is observed even when the run-and-tumble dynamics approaches Brownian motion.

For inversion-symmetric systems, there is a competition on a microscopic level between the spin-orbit coupling associated with the local lack of inversion and hybridizing terms that `restore' inversion. Investigating a layered system with alternating mirror-symmetry breaking, we study this competition considering the spin response of different superconducting order parameters for the case of strong spin-orbit coupling. We find that signatures of the local non-centrosymmetry, such as an increased spin susceptibility in spin-singlet superconductors for $T\\rightarrow 0$, persist even into the quasi-three-dimensional regime. This leads to a direction dependent spin response which allows to distinguish different superconducting order parameters.

On the one side, the color-magnitude diagrams in different bulge fields seem to indicate a uniformly old ($&gt;$10 Gyr) population. On the other side, individual ages derived from dwarfs observed through microlensing events seem to indicate a large spread, from $\\sim$ 2 to $\\sim$ 13 Gyr. Because the bulge is now recognised as being mainly a boxy peanut-shaped bar, it is suggested that disk stars are one of its main constituents, and therefore also stars with ages significantly younger than 10 Gyr. Other arguments as well point to the fact that the bulge cannot be exclusively old, and in particular cannot be a burst population, as it is usually expected if the bulge was the fossil remnant of a merger phase in the early Galaxy. In the present study, we show that given the range of metallicities observed in the bulge, a uniformly old population would be reflected into a significant spread in color at the turn-off which is not observed. Inversely, we demonstrate that the correlation between age and metallicity expected to hold for the inner disk would conspire to form a color-magnitude diagram with a remarkably small spread in color, thus mimicking the color-magnitude diagram of a uniformly old population. If stars younger than 10 Gyr are part of the bulge, as must be the case if the bulge has been mainly formed through dynamical instabilities in the disk, then a very small spread at the turn-off is expected, as seen in the observations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 11 figures.

It is known that at sufficiently high isospin chemical potential, charged pions undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The condensate behaves as a superconductor, exhibiting Meissner effect in weak external magnetic fields. Stronger fields stress the superconducting state, turning it first into an Abrikosov lattice of vortices, and eventually destroying the condensate altogether. On the other hand, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields and low-to-moderate isospin chemical potential, the ground state of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is expected to be a spatially modulated condensate of neutral pions, induced by the chiral anomaly: the chiral soliton lattice (CSL). We map the phase diagram of QCD as a function of isospin chemical potential and magnetic field in the part of the parameter space accessible to a low-energy effective field theory description of QCD. Our main result is an explicit account of the competition between the CSL and the Abrikosov vortex lattice. This is accomplished by adopting a fast numerical algorithm for finding the vortex lattice solution of the equation of motion and the corresponding Gibbs energy. We find that the Abrikosov vortex lattice phase persists in the phase diagram, separating the uniform charged pion BEC phase from the CSL phase. The precise layout of the phase diagram depends sensitively on the choice of the vacuum pion mass.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07065","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-01-19T03:53:25Z","registered":"2022-01-19T03:53:26Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-04-25T01:16:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To this aim we derive the bar fraction in three different environments ranging from the field to Virgo and Coma clusters, covering an unprecedentedly large range of galaxy luminosities (or, equivalently, stellar masses). We confirm that the fraction of barred galaxies strongly depends on galaxy luminosity. We also show that the difference between the bar fraction distributions as a function of galaxy luminosity (and mass) in the field and Coma cluster are statistically significant, with Virgo being an intermediate case. The fraction of barred galaxies shows a maximum of about 50% at $M_r\\,\\simeq\\,-20.5$ in clusters, whereas the peak is shifted to $M_r\\,\\simeq\\,-19$ in the field. We interpret this result as a variation of the effect of environment on bar formation depending on galaxy luminosity. We speculate that brighter disk galaxies are stable enough against interactions to keep their cold structure, thus, the interactions are able to trigger bar formation. For fainter galaxies the interactions become strong enough to heat up the disks inhibiting bar formation and even destroying the disks. Finally, we point out that the controversy regarding whether the bar fraction depends on environment could be resolved by taking into account the different luminosity ranges probed by the galaxy samples studied so far.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters. 1 Figure and 1 Table","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1007","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T17:32:19Z","registered":"2022-03-11T17:32:20Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T17:32:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Their effect may also reduce the timescale of angular momentum exchanges between the disk and host star during the early pre-main-sequence phase. To improve our understanding of the environmental influence on the rotational history of stars, we developed a model that considers the influence of the local far-ultraviolet radiation on the spin evolution of low mass stars. Our model includes an assumption of disk-locking, which fixes the rotation rate during the star-disk-interaction phase, with the duration of this phase parametrised as a function of the local far-ultraviolet radiation and stellar mass (in the range 0.1--1.3 M$_\\odot$). In this way, we demonstrate how the feedback from massive stars can significantly influence the spin evolution of stars and explain the mass-dependency observed in period-mass distributions of young regions like Upper Sco and NGC 2264. The high far-ultraviolet environments of high-mass stars can skew the period distribution of surrounding stars towards fast-rotation, explaining the excess of fast-rotating stars in the open cluster h Per. The proposed link between rotation and the pre-main-sequence environment opens new avenues for interpreting the rotational distributions of young stars.

However, the enormous computational demand prohibits fully coherent broadband all-sky searches for prior unknown CW sources over wide ranges of parameter space and for yearlong observation times. More efficient hierarchical \"semicoherent\" search strategies divide the data into segments much shorter than one year, which are analyzed coherently; then detection statistics from different segments are combined incoherently. To optimally perform the incoherent combination, understanding of the underlying parameter-space structure is requisite. This problem is addressed here by using new coordinates on the parameter space, which yield the first analytical parameter-space metric for the incoherent combination step. This semicoherent metric applies to broadband all-sky surveys (also embedding directed searches at fixed sky position) for isolated CW sources. Furthermore, the additional metric resolution attained through the combination of segments is studied. From the search parameters (sky position, frequency, and frequency derivatives), solely the metric resolution in the frequency derivatives is found to significantly increase with the number of segments.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 5 figures (matching Phys.Rev.D version)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0395","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T03:13:46Z","registered":"2022-03-14T03:13:48Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T03:13:48Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We find three distinct ranges in chromospheric temperature: low temperatures in the internetwork, high temperatures in the enhanced magnetic network and intermediate temperatures associated with low magnetic flux regions in the network. The differences between these regions become more pronounced with height as the plasma-$\u03b2$ decreases.

The concept of 4D printing as a targeted evolution of 3D printed structures can be realised in a two-step process. One first fabricates a 3D object with multi-material active composites and apply external loads in the programming stage. Then, a change in an environmental stimulus and the removal of loads cause the object deform in the programmed stage. The dynamic transition between the original and deformed shapes is achieved with appropriate applications of the stimulus. The mathematical interest is to find an optimal distribution for the materials such that the 3D printed object achieves a targeted configuration in the programmed stage as best as possible. Casting the problem as a PDE-constrained minimisation problem, we consider a vector-valued order parameter representing the volume fractions of the different materials in the composite as a control variable. We prove the existence of optimal designs and formulate first order necessary conditions for minimisers. Moreover, by suitable asymptotic techniques, we relate our approach to a sharp interface description. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by several numerical simulations both in two and three space dimensions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"41 pages, 54 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03706","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-07-11T00:47:22Z","registered":"2022-07-11T00:47:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-05-03T01:08:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We measure a median (V-R)=0.38+-0.06 for the UV-selected sample, bluer than a sample optically selected at R but consistent with starburst and WR galaxy colors. We demonstrate that redshifted WR emission lines can double or triple the flux through the UV bandpass at high redshifts. Thus the (UV-B) color of a WR galaxy can be up to 1.3 mag bluer at high redshift, and the expected selection function is skewed to larger redshifts. The redshift distribution of the extreme blue, UV excess galaxies matches the selection function we predict from the properties of WR galaxies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4 pages, including 4 figures.

It is known that toroidal partition functions of SL(2;R)/U(1) theory (2D Black Hole) contain two parts, continuous and discrete representations. The contribution of continuous representations is proportional to the space-time volume and is divergent in the infinite-volume limit while the part of discrete representations is volume-independent. In order to see clearly the contribution of discrete representations we consider elliptic genus which projects out the contributions of continuous representations: making use of the SL(2;R)/U(1), we compute elliptic genera for various non-compact space-times such as the conifold, ALE spaces, Calabi-Yau 3-folds with A_n singularities etc. We find that these elliptic genera in general have a complex modular property and are not Jacobi forms as opposed to the cases of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"39 pages, no figure; v2 references added, minor corrections; v3 typos corrected, to appear in JHEP; v4 typos corrected in eqs.

In a series of two-dimensional realizations, the resulting force networks are shown to satisfy a linear constraint among the three components of average stress, as anticipated by recent theories. The coefficients in the linear constraint remain nearly constant for a range of shear loadings up to about .6 of the normal loading. The spatial distribution of contact forces shows strong concentration along ``force chains\". The probability of contact forces of magnitude f shows an exponential falloff with f.

In this study, we ask what other types of information are present in CPC speech representations. We focus on three categories: phone class, gender and language, and compare monolingual and bilingual models. Using qualitative and quantitative tools, we find that both gender and phone class information are present in both types of models. Language information, however, is very salient in the bilingual model only, suggesting CPC models learn to discriminate languages when trained on multiple languages. Some language information can also be retrieved from monolingual models, but it is more diffused across all features. These patterns hold when analyses are carried on the discrete units from a downstream clustering model. However, although there is no effect of the number of target clusters on phone class and language information, more gender information is encoded with more clusters. Finally, we find that there is some cost to being exposed to two languages on a downstream phoneme discrimination task.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to INTERSPEECH 2022, 5 pages, 2 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16193","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-03-31T01:36:00Z","registered":"2022-03-31T01:36:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-06-02T09:39:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here we provide a more rigorous definition of what constitutes ``advantageous'' random distillation. We show that random distillation is always advantageous for W-class three-qubit states (but only sometimes for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-class states). We show that the general class of multiparty states known as symmetric Dicke states can be readily converted to many other states in the class via random distillation. Finally we show that random distillation is provably not advantageous in the limit of multiple copies of pure states.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, RevTeX. v2: Corrected misstatement of Horodecki et al's entanglement of assistance result, changed proof of Theorem 2 accordingly.

We carried out a multi-frequency (1-30 GHz) daily monitoring of the radio flux variability of the microquasars SS433, GRS1915+105, and Cyg X-3 during the recent sets in 2005-2007. A lot of bright short-time flares were detected from GRS 1915+105 and they could be associated with active X-ray events. In January 2006 we detected a drop down of the quiescent fluxes from Cyg X-3 (from 100 to $\\sim$20 mJy), then the 1 Jy-flare was detected on 2 February 2006 after 18 days of quenched radio emission. The daily spectra of the flare in the maximum were flat from 2 to 110 GHz, using the quasi-simultaneous observations at 110 GHz with the RT45m telescope and the NMA millimeter array of NRO in Japan. Several bright radio flaring events (1-15 Jy) followed during the continuing state of very variable and intensive 1-12 keV X-ray emission ($\\sim$0.5 Crab), which was monitored in the RXTE ASM program. Swift/BAT ASM hard X-ray fluxes correlated strongly with flaring radio data. The various spectral and temporal characteristics of the light curves from the microquasars could be determined from such comparison. We conclude that monitoring of the flaring radio emission is a good tracer of jet activity X-ray binaries.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 8 figures, published in the proceedings of the Second Kolkata conference on Observational Evidence for Black Holes in the Universe, ed.

This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of unsupervised and semi-supervised deep-learning based methods for anomaly detection and diagnosis on multivariate time series data from cyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and post-processing of model errors, i.e. the scoring functions independently of each other, through a grid of 10 models and 4 scoring functions, comparing these variants to state of the art methods. In time-series anomaly detection, detecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual anomalous time-points. Through experiments, we find that the existing evaluation metrics either do not take events into account, or cannot distinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or an all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks, namely, the composite F-score ($Fc_1$), for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. Our study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than static ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of scoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model. We also find that a simple, channel-wise model - the Univariate Fully-Connected Auto-Encoder, with the dynamic Gaussian scoring function emerges as a winning candidate for both anomaly detection and diagnosis, beating state of the art algorithms.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11428","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T08:59:31Z","registered":"2022-02-21T08:59:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T08:59:35Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We provide relevant yet unexpected numerical values for the physical parameters and achieve four times more randomness than previous methods.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7629","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T19:07:39Z","registered":"2022-03-09T19:07:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T19:07:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Prophet multi-versioning Cache system along with thread state control mechanism in architectural support are utilized for buffering the speculative data, and a snooping bus based cache coherence protocol is used to detect data dependence violation. The simulation-based evaluation shows that the Prophet system could achieve significant speedup for general-purpose programs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3224","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T18:25:32Z","registered":"2022-03-08T18:25:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T18:25:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We have therefore performed four- to six-component (pseudo-)bulge/disk/bar/ring/point source) decompositions of the composite (Hubble Space Telescope plus ground-based) surface brightness profiles. We find that NGC 2681 hosts three bars, while NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 are double- and single-barred galaxies, respectively, in agreement with past isophotal analysis. We find that the bulges in these galaxies are compact, and have S\u00e9rsic indices of $n\\sim 2.2 - 3.6$ and stellar masses of $M_{*}$ $\\sim 0.28\\times10^{10} - 1.1\\times10^{10} M_{\\sun}$. NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have intermediate-scale `pseudo-bulges' that are well described by a S\u00e9rsic model with low $n \\la 0.5$ instead of an exponential ($n=1$) profile as done in the past. We measure emission line fluxes enclosed within 9 different elliptical apertures, finding that NGC 2681 has a LINER-type emission inside $R \\sim 3\\arcsec$, but the emission line due to star formation is significant when aperture size is increased. In contrast, NGC 3945 and NGC 4371 have composite (AGN plus star forming)- and LINER-type emissions inside and outside $R \\sim 2\\arcsec$, respectively. Our findings suggest that the three galaxies have experienced a complex evolutionary path. The bulges appear to be consequences of an earlier violent merging event while subsequent disk formation via gas accretion and bar-driven perturbations may account for the build-up of pseudo-bulges, bars, rings and point sources.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 6 figures (some with low quality due to arXiv file size limitations), accepted (2016 July 25) for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03539","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T20:14:33Z","registered":"2022-03-05T20:14:34Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T20:14:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our study is based on a realistic Bethe-Salpeter amplitude for the deuteron, which is obtained as a solution to the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with a realistic NN kernel. Particular effort is made to connect the structure functions to the densities of the appropriate charges and currents. This allows for a systematic comparison between the relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations, by analysing the same densities in both approaches. Thus, the sources of the relativistic effects in the structure functions are understood and clearly distinguished from variations caused by the differences in the model parameters. We present both the formalism and extensive numerical calculations for all steps of our analysis. We find that the nonrelativistic and relativistic calculations are qualitatively very much alike. However, three main features systematically distinguish a consistent relativistic approach from the nonrelativistic one: (i) the binding effects are larger, (ii) the effect of Fermi motion at high $x$ is stronger and (iii) the relativistic description of the structure functions b_{1,2}^D is fully consistent, unlike the nonrelativistic approach, which is internally inconsistent and violates the fundamental sum rules.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"29 pages of text using revtex, plus 15 Postscript figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9608459","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-22T00:28:36Z","registered":"2022-03-22T00:28:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-22T00:28:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This result implies that in the potential energy dominated regime ($\\ell\\ge\\ell_s\\gg\u03bb^{-1}$), the inverse energy transfer is strongly impeded, in the sense that under the usual time scale no significant transfer of energy to larger scales occurs. The physical implication is that the elasticity of the free surface impedes turbulent energy transfer in wavenumber space, effectively rendering large-scale vortices long-lived and inactive. Results from numerical simulations of forced-dissipative turbulence confirm this prediction.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in JFM","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0512007","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T21:49:55Z","registered":"2022-03-17T21:49:55Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T21:49:55Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The results predict that a camphor particle with an $n=3$ mode modification from a circle, i.e., a triangular modification, moves in the direction of a corner for a small particle, while it moves in the direction of a side for a large particle. The numerical simulation results well reproduce the theoretical prediction. The present study will help understand the effect of the particle shape on spontaneous motion.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08019","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T02:05:50Z","registered":"2022-02-27T02:05:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T02:05:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Large amounts of molecular gas (1.4 x 10^{10} Msun, using the standard Galactic CO-to-H$_2$ conversion applicable to Galactic disk giant molecular clouds [GMCs]) were clearly detected throughout the taffy bridge between the two galaxies, which, as in the more extreme case of HI, presumably results from a head-on collision between the two galaxies. The highest CO concentration between the two galaxies corresponds to the H_alpha source in the taffy bridge near the intruder galaxy UGC 12915. This HII region is also associated with the strongest source of radio continuum in the bridge, and shows both morphological and kinematic connections to UGC 12915. The overall CO distribution of the entire system agrees well with that of the radio continuum emission, particularly in the taffy bridge. This argues for the star formation origin of a significant portion of the radio continuum emission. Compared to the HI morphology and kinematics, which are strongly distorted owing to the high-speed collision, CO better defines the orbital geometry and impact parameter of the interaction, as well as the disk properties (e.g., rotation, orientation) of the progenitor galaxies. Based on the 20cm-to-CO ratio maps, we conclude that the starburst sites are primarily located in UGC 12915 and the H_alpha source in the bridge and show that the molecular gas in the taffy bridge is forming into stars with star formation efficiency comparable to that of the target galaxy UGC 12914 and similar to that in the Galactic disk.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Minor typo/style corrections to match with the published version (AJ, Nov. issue).

Motivated by this concept, magnetic skyrmions, topologically nontrivial spin textures, are expected to exhibit the topological stability, thereby offering a prospect as a nanometer-scale non-volatile information carrier. In real materials, however, atomic spins are configured as not continuous but discrete distribution, which raises a fundamental question if the topological stability is indeed preserved for real magnetic skyrmions. Answering this question necessitates a direct comparison between topologically nontrivial and trivial spin textures, but the direct comparison in one sample under the same magnetic fields has been challenging. Here we report how to selectively achieve either a skyrmion state or a topologically trivial bubble state in a single specimen and thereby show how robust the skyrmion structure is in comparison with the bubbles for the first time. We demonstrate that topologically nontrivial magnetic skyrmions show longer lifetimes than trivial bubble structures, evidencing the topological stability in a real discrete system. Our work corroborates the physical importance of the topology in the magnetic materials, which has hitherto been suggested by mathematical arguments, providing an important step towards ever-dense and more-stable magnetic devices.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00630","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T20:55:32Z","registered":"2022-02-26T20:55:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T20:55:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our approach is based on the forward-backward envelope (FBE), an exact and strictly continuous penalty function for the original cost. Extending previous results we show that, despite being nonsmooth for fully nonconvex problems, the FBE still enjoys favorable first- and second-order properties which are key for the convergence results of ZeroFPR.

Here we introduce artificial lattices made of lead halide perovskite nanocubes as a new platform to simulate and investigate the physics of correlated quantum materials. The ultrafast optical injection of quantum confined excitons plays the role of doping in real materials. We show that, at large photo-doping, the exciton gas undergoes an excitonic Mott transition, which fully realizes the magnetic-field-driven insulator-to-metal transition described by the Hubbard model. At lower photo-doping, the long-range interactions drive the formation of a collective superradiant state, in which the phases of the excitons generated in each single perovskite nanocube are coherently locked. Our results demonstrate that time-resolved experiments span a parameter region of the Hubbard model in which long-range and phase-coherent orders emerge out of a doped Mott insulating phase. This physics is relevant for a broad class of phenomena, such as superconductivity and charge-density waves in correlated materials whose properties are captured by doped Hubbard models.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08791","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-03-16T01:02:42Z","registered":"2023-03-16T01:02:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-11-27T03:10:11Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

After expansion and cooling, the hadrons are created in a freeze-out. Their distribution describes the final state of this medium. In particular their azimuthal asymmetry, characterized by the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$, is one of the most important observables in heavy ion physics. In recent years it has been revealed that if measuring relative to higher order event planes $\u03a8_n$, higher order flow coefficients $v_n$ for $n&gt;2$ can be measured. This is due to initial state fluctuations, previously not described by analytic solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics. In this paper we show the first solutions that utilize higher order asymmetries and thus yield realistic $v_n$ flow coefficients. It is a clear consequence of this that different flow patterns may lead to the same observed flow coefficients. We also compare our results to PHENIX measurements and determine a possible parameter set corresponding to these data.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 6 figures, accepted in Phys.

The X-ray emission observed at ~10 days is attributed to inverse Compton scattering of photospheric photons with relativistic electrons produced in the interaction of the supernova with the progenitor wind. A simple model for the optical/ultraviolet emission from shock breakout is developed and applied to SN 1987A, SN 1999ex, SN 2008D, and SN 2006aj, all of which have optical emission observed at t~1 day. The emission from the first three can plausibly be attributed to shock breakout emission. The photospheric temperature is most sensitive to the radius of the progenitor star core and the radii in these cases are in line with expectations from stellar evolution. The early optical/ultraviolet observations of SN 2006aj cannot be accommodated by a shock breakout model in a straightforward way.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Revised, accepted version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0371","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T00:10:52Z","registered":"2022-03-16T00:10:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T00:10:53Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We search for low-state VHE gamma-ray emission from PKS 1510-089. We aim to characterize and model the source in a broad-band context, which would provide a baseline over which high states and flares could be better understood. We use daily binned Fermi-LAT flux measurements of PKS 1510-089 to characterize the GeV emission and select the observation periods of MAGIC during low state of activity. For the selected times we compute the average radio, IR, optical, UV, X-ray and gamma-ray emission to construct a low-state spectral energy distribution of the source. The broadband emission is modelled within an External Compton scenario with a stationary emission region through which plasma and magnetic field are flowing. We perform also the emission-model-independent calculations of the maximum absorption in the broad line region (BLR) using two different models. Results. The MAGIC telescopes collected 75 hrs of data during times when the Fermi-LAT flux measured above 1 GeV was below 3x10-8cm-2s-1, which is the threshold adopted for the definition of a low gamma-ray activity state. The data show a strongly significant (9.5\u03c3) VHE gamma-ray emission at the level of (4.27+-0.61stat)x10-12cm-2s-1 above 150GeV, a factor 80 smaller than the highest flare observed so far from this object. Despite the lower flux, the spectral shape is consistent with earlier detections in the VHE band. The broad-band emission is compatible with the EC scenario assuming a large emission region located beyond the BLR. For the first time the gamma-ray data allow us to place a limit on the location of the emission region during a low gamma-ray state of a FSRQ. For the used model of the BLR, the 95% C.L. on the location of the emission region allows us to place it at the distance &gt;74% of the outer radius of the BLR.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05367","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T10:13:55Z","registered":"2022-03-02T10:13:56Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T10:13:56Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In particular, some questions remain unanswered nowadays concerning the temperature dependence of bulk and interfacial transport properties of supercooled and liquid water, e.g. regarding the fundamentals of the violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation in the supercooled regime or the subtle relation between structure and dynamical properties. Here we investigated the temperature dependence of the bulk transport properties from ab initio molecular dynamics based on density functional theory, down to the supercooled regime. We determined from a selection of functionals, that SCAN better describes the experimental viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient, although we found disagreements at the lowest temperatures. For a limited set of temperatures, we also explored the role of nuclear quantum effects on water dynamics using ab initio molecular dynamics that has been accelerated via a recently introduced machine learning approach. We then investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the different functionals performance and assessed the validity of the Stokes-Einstein relation. We also explored the connection between structural properties and the transport coefficients, verifying the validity of the excess entropy scaling relations for all the functionals. These results pave the way to predict the transport coefficients from the radial distribution function, helping to develop better functionals. On this line, they indicate the importance of describing the long-range features of the radial distribution function.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05525","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-19T05:41:29Z","registered":"2022-02-19T05:41:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-07-07T01:14:21Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It has already been noted that in presence of a thermal medium such an electromagnetic interaction translates into the neutrino acquiring a small effective charge. In this work, we extend this concept to the case of a thermal medium in presence of an external magnetic field and calculate the effective charge of a neutrino in the limit of a weak magnetic field. We find that the effective charge is direction dependent which is a direct effect of magnetic field breaking the isotropy of the space.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Actual published version.

The significant increase in the data rate poses challenges for online and offline reconstruction as well as for data compression. Compared to Run 2, the online farm must process 50 times more events per second and achieve a higher data compression factor. ALICE will rely on GPUs to perform real time processing and data compression of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detector in real time, the biggest contributor to the data rate. With GPUs available in the online farm, we are evaluating their usage also for the full tracking chain during the asynchronous reconstruction for the silicon Inner Tracking System (ITS) and Transition Radiation Detector (TRD). The software is written in a generic way, such that it can also run on processors on the WLCG with the same reconstruction output. We give an overview of the status and the current performance of the reconstruction and the data compression implementations on the GPU for the TPC and for the global reconstruction.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 4 figures, proceedings of CHEP 2019 conference","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04158","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T17:35:22Z","registered":"2022-02-24T17:35:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T17:35:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

For the $t-t'-U$ Hubbard model, the four-site plaquette is known to have a quantum critical point in the $U-\u03bc$ space where states with electron occupations $N=2, 3, 4$ per plaquette are degenerate [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 94}, 125133 (2016)]. We show that such a critical point in the lattice causes an instability in the particle-particle singlet d-wave channel and manifests some of the essential elements of the cuprate superconductivity. For this purpose we design an efficient superperturbation theory -- based on the dual fermion approach -- with the critical plaquette as the reference system. Thus, the perturbation theory already contains the relevant d-wave fluctuations from the beginning via the two-particle correlations of the plaquette. We find that d-wave superconductivity remains a leading instability channel under reasonably broad range of parameters. The next-nearest-neighbour hopping $t'$ is shown to play a crucial role in a formation of strongly bound electronic bipolarons whose coherence at lower temperature results in superconductivity. The physics of the pseudogap within the developed picture is also discussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages, 28 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11344","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-21T18:54:51Z","registered":"2022-02-21T18:54:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-05-06T01:33:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Several predictions are made to test these ideas.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"REVTex, 3 figures available upon request","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9508061","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T06:23:27Z","registered":"2022-03-20T06:23:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T06:23:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These flows have a simple one loop structure. They differ in their dependence on the full field-dependent propagator, which is linear for exact flows. We investigate the inherent approximations of flows with a non-linear dependence on the propagator. We check explicitly that standard perturbation theory is not reproduced. We explain the origin of the discrepancy by providing links to exact flows both in closed expressions and in given approximations. We show that proper-time flows are approximations to Callan-Symanzik flows. Within a background field formalism, we provide a generalised proper-time flow, which is exact. Implications of these findings are discussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"33 pages, 15 figures, revtex, typos corrected, to be published in Phys.Rev.D","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0202188","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T01:28:36Z","registered":"2022-03-19T01:28:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T01:28:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It rests upon a converging inflow of molecular gas building up a first population of pre-main sequence stars. The associated just-formed O stars ionise the inflow and suppress star formation in the embedded cluster. However, they typically eject each other out of the embedded cluster within 10^6 yr, that is before the molecular cloud filament can be ionised entirely. The inflow of molecular gas can then resume forming a second population. This sequence of events can be repeated multiply. This model is applied to the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), in which three well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster have recently been discovered. The mass-inflow history is constrained using this model and the number of OB stars ejected from each population are estimated for verification using Gaia data. As a consequence of the proposed model, the three runaway O star systems, AE Aur, mu Col and iota Ori, are considered as significant observational evidence for stellar-dynamical ejections of massive stars from the oldest population in the ONC.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A.

The data set is disaggregated into four major profiles of agile organisations: laggards, execution specialists, experimenters, and leaders. The approach to agile transformation is analysed by each of those profiles. While the positive effect from a more holistic approach is confirmed, leaders tend to focus more on processes and products rather than project work. Respondents perceive that IT, product development and research are most agile functions within their organisations, while human resources, finance and administration are considered being not agile. Further, organisations with higher levels of organisational agility tend use more than one agile scaling framework.

The unstable isolated systems evolve under planet-planet scattering to yield an eccentricity distribution that matches that observed for extrasolar planets. When planetesimals are included the outcome depends upon the total mass of the planets. For system masses exceeding about one Jupiter mass the final eccentricity distribution remains broad, whereas for lower mass planetary systems a combination of divergent orbital evolution and recircularization of scattered planets results in a preponderance of nearly circular final orbits. We also study the fate of marginally stable multiple planet systems in the presence of planetesimal disks, and find that for high planet masses the majority of such systems evolve into resonance.

This method yields a distance of 2.5kpc with an uncertainty of about 10% and can be applied to other young and embedded clusters. Mercer14 shows clear signs of ongoing star formation with several detected molecular hydrogen outflows, a high fraction of infrared excess sources and an association to a small gas and dust cloud. Hence, the cluster is less than 4Myrs old and has a line of sight extinction of A_K=0.8mag.

The method in this work, the Line-Circle-Square (LCS) filter, claims that mobile robots without a large database for object recognition and highly advanced prediction methods can deal with incoming objects that the camera captures in real-time. The proposed filter applies detection, tracking and learning to each defined expert to extract higher level information for judging scenes without over-calculation. The interactive learning feed between each expert increases the consistency of detected landmarks that works against overwhelming detected features in crowded scenes. Our experts are dependent on trust factors' covariance under the geometric definitions to ignore, emerge and compare detected landmarks. The experiment validates the effectiveness of the proposed filter in terms of detection precision and resource usage in both experimental and real-world scenarios.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 19 figures, accepted at the Elsevier's Robotics and Autonomous Systems journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09315","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T17:08:43Z","registered":"2022-02-25T17:08:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T17:08:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We capture the competition between self-propulsion and crowding effects using a two-dimensional model of self-propelled hard disks, which we study using Monte-Carlo simulations. Although the activity drives the system far from equilibrium, self-propelled particles undergo a kinetic arrest, which we characterize in detail and compare with its equilibrium counterpart. In particular, the critical density for dynamic arrest continuously shifts to larger density with increasing activity, and the relaxation time is surprisingly well described by an algebraic divergence resulting from the emergence of highly collective dynamics. These results show that dense assemblies of active particles undergo a nonequilibrium glass transition which is profoundly affected by self-propulsion mechanisms.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages; Phys.

Moreover, based on density matrix renormalization group numerical calculations, endorsed by an analytical Gaussian approximation for the cavity state, we propose a direct link between those observables and quantum entropy singularities. We study two bipartite entanglement measures, the von Neumann and R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropies, between light and matter subsystems. Even though both display singularities at the topological phase transition points, remarkably only the R\u00e9nyi entropy can be analytically connected to the measurable Fano factor. Consequently, we show a method to recover the bipartite entanglement of the system from a cavity observable. Thus, we put forward a path to experimentally access the control and detection of a topological quantum phase transition via the R\u00e9nyi entropy, which can be measured by standard low noise linear amplification techniques in superconducting circuits.

However, a study of the vibrational properties of TiS3, relevant to understanding the electron-phonon interaction which can be the main mechanism limiting the charge carrier mobility, is still lacking. In this work, we take the first steps to study the vibrational properties of TiS3 through temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy measurements of TiS3 nanoribbons and nanosheets. Our investigation shows that all the Raman modes linearly soften (red shift) as the temperature increases from 88 K to 570 K, due to the anharmonic vibrations of the lattice which also includes contributions from the lattice thermal expansion. This softening with the temperature of the TiS3 modes is more pronounced than that observed in other 2D semiconductors such as MoS2, MoSe2, WSe2 or black phosphorus (BP). This marked temperature dependence of the Raman could be exploited to determine the temperature of TiS3 nanodevices by using Raman spectroscopy as a non-invasive and local thermal probe. Interestingly, the TiS3 nanosheets show a stronger temperature dependence of the Raman modes than the nanoribbons, which we attribute to a lower interlayer coupling in the nanosheets.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 6 figures, 1 table","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05605","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T17:08:32Z","registered":"2022-03-07T17:08:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T17:08:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our work underlines the importance of carefully considering and analyzing features in order to build efficient SER systems. We present a new supervised SER method based on an efficient feature engineering approach. We pay particular attention to the explainability of results to evaluate feature relevance and refine feature sets. This is performed iteratively through feature evaluation loop, using Shapley values to boost feature selection and improve overall framework performance. Our approach allows thus to balance the benefits between model performance and transparency. The proposed method outperforms human-level performance (HLP) and state-of-the-art machine learning methods in emotion recognition on the TESS dataset.

Achieving a detailed understanding of structure-property relationships in these materials has been challenged by the compositional disorder that underlies their unique mechanical behavior. Accordingly, in this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the nature of local chemical order and establish its relationship to the intrinsic and extrinsic stacking fault energy (SFE) in CrCoNi medium-entropy solid-solution alloys, whose combination of strength, ductility and toughness properties approach the best on record. We find that the average intrinsic and extrinsic SFE are both highly tunable, with values ranging from -43 mJ.m-2 to 30 mJ.m-2 and from -28 mJ.m-2 to 66 mJ.m-2, respectively, as the degree of local chemical order increases. The state of local ordering also strongly correlates with the energy difference between the face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal-close packed (hcp) phases, which affects the occurrence of transformation-induced plasticity. This theoretical study demonstrates that chemical short-range order is thermodynamically favored in HEAs and can be tuned to affect the mechanical behavior of these alloys. It thus addresses the pressing need to establish robust processing-structure-property relationships to guide the science-based design of new HEAs with targeted mechanical behavior.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00718","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T00:53:30Z","registered":"2022-03-02T00:53:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T00:53:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The white paper discusses the status of past and current attempts to observe GRBs at GeV-TeV energies, including a handful of low-significance, possible detections. The white paper concentrates on the potential of future ground-based gamma-ray experiments to observe the highest energy emission ever recorded for GRBs, particularly for those that are nearby and have high Lorentz factors in the GRB jet. It is clear that the detection of VHE emission would have strong implications for GRB models, as well as cosmic ray origin. In particular, the extended emission phase (including both afterglow emission and possible flaring) of nearby long GRBs could provide the best possibility for detection. The difficult-to-obtain observations during the prompt phase of nearby long GRBs and short GRBs could also provide particularly strong constraints on the opacity and bulk Lorentz factors surrounding the acceleration site. The synergy with upcoming and existing observatories will, of course, be critical for both identification of GRBs and for multiwavelength/multimessenger studies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"to appear in Proceedings of Gamma Ray Bursts 2007 Meeting, Santa Fe, New Mexico; 5 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2256","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T07:04:23Z","registered":"2022-03-16T07:04:24Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T07:04:24Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, locally semantic change, such as scene composition, relative position between objects, spectral variability caused by illumination, atmospheric effects, and material mixture, has been less frequently investigated in modeling spatial information. As a consequence, identifying the same materials from spatially different scenes or positions can be difficult. In this paper, we propose a solution to address this issue by locally extracting invariant features from hyperspectral imagery (HSI) in both spatial and frequency domains, using a method called invariant attribute profiles (IAPs). IAPs extract the spatial invariant features by exploiting isotropic filter banks or convolutional kernels on HSI and spatial aggregation techniques (e.g., superpixel segmentation) in the Cartesian coordinate system. Furthermore, they model invariant behaviors (e.g., shift, rotation) by the means of a continuous histogram of oriented gradients constructed in a Fourier polar coordinate. This yields a combinatorial representation of spatial-frequency invariant features with application to HSI classification. Extensive experiments conducted on three promising hyperspectral datasets (Houston2013 and Houston2018) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed IAP method in comparison with several state-of-the-art profile-related techniques.

We use this new model to study the impact of the choice of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model on the predicted evolution of the galaxy luminosity function. The semi-analytical model is run using seven different SPS models. In each case we obtain the rest-frame luminosity function in the far-ultra-violet, optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength ranges. We find that both the predicted rest-frame ultra-violet and optical luminosity function are insensitive to the choice of SPS model. However, we find that the predicted evolution of the rest-frame NIR luminosity function depends strongly on the treatment of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase in the SPS models, with differences larger than a factor of 2 for model galaxies brighter than $M_{\\rm AB}(K)-5$log$h","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, 19 figures, MNRAS.

Our result is competitive with other lower bounds on $m_\u03c7$ from past analyses, which rely on intermediate modelling of structure formation and/or baryonic effects.

The model leads to a rich phenomenology while satisfying all the current constraints imposed by neutrinoless double-beta decay, charged-lepton flavor violation, and electroweak precision observables. The relatively large Yukawa couplings lead to sizable rates for charged lepton flavor violation processes, well within future experimental reach.

We detect a number of starless and prestellar cores and protostellar envelopes. We also detect a number of filaments for the first time in the submillimetre continuum that are parallel both to each other, and to filaments observed in the neighbouring L1688 cloud. These filaments are also seen in the 13CO observations of L1689. The filaments contain all of the star-formation activity in the cloud. L1689 lies next to the well studied L1688 cloud that contains the rho Oph-A core. L1688 has a much more active star-formation history than L1689 despite their apparent similarity in 13CO data. Hence we label L1689 as the dog that didn't bark. We endeavour to explain this apparent anomaly by comparing the total mass of each cloud that is currently in the form of dense material such as prestellar cores. We note firstly that L1688 is more massive than L1689, but we also find that when normalised to the total mass of each cloud, the L1689 cloud has a much lower percentage of mass in dense cores than L1688. We attribute this to the hypothesis of Loren (1989) that the star formation in the rho-Ophiuchi complex is being affected and probably dominated by the external influence of the nearby Upper Scorpius OB association and predominantly by sigma-Sco. L1689 is further from sigma-Sco and is therefore less active. The influence of sigma-Sco appears nonetheless to have created the filaments that we observe in L1689.

An additional discriminator network is introduced to distinguish the deep features generated by the SD model from those produced by the SI model. In ASA, with a fixed SI model as the reference, an SD model is jointly optimized with the discriminator network to minimize the senone classification loss, and simultaneously to mini-maximize the SI/SD discrimination loss on the adaptation data. With ASA, a senone-discriminative deep feature is learned in the SD model with a similar distribution to that of the SI model.

However, one challenge therein is the dynamics at the network edge. In this paper, we study how to place service instances to cope with these dynamics, where multiple users and service instances coexist in the system. Our goal is to find the optimal placement (configuration) of instances to minimize the average cost over time, leveraging the ability of predicting future cost parameters with known accuracy. We first propose an offline algorithm that solves for the optimal configuration in a specific look-ahead time-window. Then, we propose an online approximation algorithm with polynomial time-complexity to find the placement in real-time whenever an instance arrives. We analytically show that the online algorithm is $O(1)$-competitive for a broad family of cost functions. Afterwards, the impact of prediction errors is considered and a method for finding the optimal look-ahead window size is proposed, which minimizes an upper bound of the average actual cost. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulations with both synthetic and real-world (San Francisco taxi) user-mobility traces. The theoretical methodology used in this paper can potentially be applied to a larger class of dynamic resource allocation problems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"This is the author's version of the paper accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02735","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T18:05:14Z","registered":"2022-03-08T18:05:18Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T18:05:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The presence of a \u03b4-function singularity, which comes from the Zeeman spin interaction with the magnetic flux tube, is addressed by the self-adjoint extension method. One of the advantages of the present approach is the determination of the self-adjoint extension parameter in terms of physics of the problem. Expressions for the energy bound states, phase-shift and $S$ matrix are determined in terms of the self-adjoint extension parameter, which is explicitly determined in terms of the parameters of the problem. The relation between the bound state and zero modes and the failure of helicity conservation in the scattering problem and its relation with the gyromagnetic ratio $g$ are discussed.

In this work, we addressed the molecular changes induced in cortical astrocytes by few-layer graphene (FLG) and graphene oxide (GO) flakes. Our results show that exposure to FLG/GO does not affect cell viability or proliferation. However, proteomic and lipidomic analyses unveiled alterations in several cellular processes, including intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis and cholesterol metabolism, which were particularly intense in cells exposed to GO. Indeed, GO exposure impaired spontaneous and evoked astrocyte [Ca2+]i signals and induced a marked increase in membrane cholesterol levels. Importantly, cholesterol depletion fully rescued [Ca2+]i dynamics in GO-treated cells, indicating a causal relationship between these GO-mediated effects. Our results indicate that exposure to GNMs alters intracellular signaling in astrocytes and may impact on astrocyte-neuron interactions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"This document is the unedited Author's version of a Submitted Work that was subsequently accepted for publication in Small after peer review.

For theories with perturbative anomalies, we demonstrate the obstruction by analyzing the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions and current Ward identities in the presence of a boundary. We then recast the problem in terms of symmetry defects and find the same conclusions for anomalies of discrete and orientation-reversing global symmetries, up to the conjecture that global gravitational anomalies, which may not be associated with any diffeomorphism symmetry, also forbid the existence of boundary conditions.

We investigate quantitatively the ME coupling of spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles with uniform diameters (d) from 3 to 15 nm embedded in an insulating host, using a sensitive ME susceptometer. The intrinsic ME susceptibility (MES) of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles is measured, exhibiting a maximum value of ~0.6 ps/m at 5 K for d=15 nm. We found that the MES is reduced with reduced d but remains finite until d=~5 nm, which is close to the critical thickness for observing the Verwey transition. Moreover, with reduced diameter, the critical temperature below which the MES becomes conspicuous increased systematically from 9.8 K in the bulk to 19.7 K in the nanoparticles with d=7 nm, reflecting the core-shell effect on the ME properties. These results point to a new pathway for investigating ME effect in various nanomaterials.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00281","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T14:12:52Z","registered":"2022-03-03T14:12:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T14:12:53Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In order to construct those templates we need to account for the gravitational backreaction, that is, how the gravitational field of the SCO affects its own trajectory. In general relativity, the backreaction can be described in terms of a local self-force, and the foundations to compute it have been laid recently. Due to its complexity, some parts of the calculation of the self-force have to be performed numerically.

Furthermore, its thermodynamics differs from the seed solution, since our solution is always stable and does not have phase transitions.

In the current cosmological paradigm, a dark-matter-sheet 3D manifold, inhabiting 6D position-velocity phase space, was flat (with vanishing velocity) at the big bang. Afterward, gravity stretched and bunched the sheet together in different places, forming a cosmic web when projected to the position coordinates. Here, I explain some properties of an origami approximation, in which the sheet does not stretch or contract (an assumption that is false in general), but is allowed to fold. Even without stretching, the sheet can form an idealized cosmic web, with convex polyhedral voids separated by straight walls and filaments, joined by convex polyhedral nodes. The nodes form in 'polygonal' or 'polyhedral' collapse, somewhat like spherical/ellipsoidal collapse, except incorporating simultaneous filament and wall formation. The origami approximation allows phase-space geometries of nodes, filaments, and walls to be more easily understood, and may aid in understanding spin correlations between nearby galaxies. This contribution explores kinematic origami-approximation models giving velocity fields for the first time.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 5 figures.

For instance, distributed data storage systems can use causally ordered message delivery to ensure causal consistency, and CRDTs can rely on the existence of an underlying causally-ordered messaging layer to simplify their implementation. A causal delivery protocol ensures that when a message is delivered to a process, any causally preceding messages sent to the same process have already been delivered to it. While causal delivery protocols are widely used, verification of their correctness is less common, much less machine-checked proofs about executable implementations. We implemented a standard causal broadcast protocol in Haskell and used the Liquid Haskell solver-aided verification system to express and mechanically prove that messages will never be delivered to a process in an order that violates causality. We express this property using refinement types and prove that it holds of our implementation, taking advantage of Liquid Haskell's underlying SMT solver to automate parts of the proof and using its manual theorem-proving features for the rest. We then put our verified causal broadcast implementation to work as the foundation of a distributed key-value store.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Appeared at IFL 2022","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14767","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-06-30T01:11:27Z","registered":"2022-06-30T01:11:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-03-16T01:07:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We describe the unknown shape by a radial function in 3D, and induce a correlation structure via a Gaussian process. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to reduce the computational complexity of working with 3D data. This is accomplished by casting the tracking problem into projection planes which are attached to the object's local frame. The resulting algorithms can process 3D point cloud data and accomplish tracking of a dynamic object. Furthermore, they provide analytical expressions for the representation of the object shape in 3D, together with confidence intervals. The confidence intervals, which quantify the uncertainty in the shape estimate, can later be used for solving the gating and association problems inherent in object tracking. The performance of the methods is demonstrated both on simulated and real data. The results are compared with an existing random matrix model, which is commonly used for extended object tracking in the literature.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11358","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T19:51:36Z","registered":"2022-02-27T19:51:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T19:51:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It supports multi-scale topological analysis and visualization of feature-rich scientific data. Several parallel algorithms have been proposed towards the fast computation of the 3D Morse-Smale complex. Its computation continues to pose significant algorithmic challenges. In particular, the non-trivial structure of the connections between the saddle critical points are not amenable to parallel computation. This paper describes a fine grained parallel algorithm for computing the Morse-Smale complex and a GPU implementation gMSC. The algorithm first determines the saddle-saddle reachability via a transformation into a sequence of vector operations, and next computes the paths between saddles by transforming it into a sequence of matrix operations. Computational experiments show that the method achieves up to 8.6x speedup over pyms3d and 6x speedup over TTK, the current shared memory implementations. The paper also presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of different steps of the algorithm and reports on their contribution towards runtime performance. Finally, it introduces a CPU based data parallel algorithm for simplifying the Morse-Smale complex via iterative critical point pair cancellation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"This is a full-length TVCG journal paper as an extension of the paper 'GPU Parallel Computation of Morse-Smale Complexes' published in the Proceedings of IEEE VIS (Short Papers) 2020","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03707","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-24T01:04:35Z","registered":"2022-02-24T01:04:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-11-07T03:34:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

If unaccounted for, interstellar medium absorption (ISM) at the position of specific UV lines might bias transit depth measurements, and thus potentially affect the (non-)detection of features in transmission spectra. Ultimately, this is connected to the so called ``resolution-linked bias'' (RLB) effect. We present a parametric study quantifying the impact of unresolved or unconsidered ISM absorption in transit depth measurements at the position of the MgII h&amp;k resonance lines (i.e. 2802.705 \u00c5 and 2795.528 \u00c5 respectively) in the near-ultraviolet spectral range. We consider main-sequence stars of different spectral types and vary the shape and amount of chromospheric emission, ISM absorption, and planetary absorption, as well as their relative velocities. We also evaluate the role played by integration bin and spectral resolution. We present an open-source tool enabling one to quantify the impact of unresolved or unconsidered MgII ISM absorption in transit depth measurements. We further apply this tool to a few already or soon to be observed systems. On average, we find that ignoring ISM absorption leads to biases in the MgII transit depth measurements comparable to the uncertainties obtained from the observations published to date. However, considering the bias induced by ISM absorption might become necessary when analysing observations obtained with the next generation space telescopes with UV coverage (e.g. LUVOIR, HABEX), which will provide transmission spectra with significantly smaller uncertainties compared to what obtained with current facilities (e.g. HST).","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06192","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-12-14T01:46:15Z","registered":"2022-12-14T01:46:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-02-23T20:44:24Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Numerical calculations show that the weak localization effect suppresses the absorption by the excitation across the gap to a greater extent than that by thermal excitation, which is a similar tendency to the results of experiments. The ratio of the linear absorption with vertex corrections to that without the corrections shows a large variation at the frequency that is around twice the energy of the superconducting gap.

They have been extensively represented by the mathematical FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model [Barkley et al., Phys. Rev. A 42, 2489 (1990)] of excitable media. In incompressible fluid simulations also excitation of thermal spiral waves have been reported by Li et al. [Phys. of Fluids 22, 011701 (2010)]. In the present manuscript the spatiotemporal development of spiral waves in the context of weak and strong coupling limits have been shown. While the weakly coupled medium has been represented by a simple fluid description, for the strong coupling a generalized visco - elastic fluid description has been employed. The medium has been driven by an external force in the form of a rotating electric field. It is shown that when the amplitude of force is small the density perturbations in the medium are also small. In this case the excitations do not develop as a spiral wave. Only when the amplitude of force is high so as to drive the density perturbations to nonlinear amplitudes does the spiral density wave formation occur. The role of forcing frequency, the effect of strong coupling and sound velocity of medium on the formation and evolution of spiral waves have been investigated in detail.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04001","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T23:45:12Z","registered":"2022-03-03T23:45:13Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T23:45:13Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Such technology is especially appealing when large areas to be covered and material budget are concerned. This is the case of the outermost pixel layers of the future ATLAS tracking detector for the HL-LHC. For experiments at hadron colliders, radiation hardness is a key requirement which is not fulfilled by standard CMOS sensor designs that collect charge by diffusion. This issue has been addressed by depleted active pixel sensors in which electronics are embedded into a large deep implantation ensuring uniform charge collection by drift. Very first small prototypes of hybrid depleted active pixel sensors have already shown a radiation hardness compatible with the ATLAS requirements. Nevertheless, to compete with the present hybrid solutions a further reduction in costs achievable by a fully monolithic design is desirable. The H35DEMO is a large electrode full reticle demonstrator chip produced in AMS 350 nm HV-CMOS technology by the collaboration of Karlsruher Institut f\u00fcr Technologie (KIT), Institut de F\u00edsica d'Altes Energies (IFAE), University of Liverpool and University of Geneva. It includes two large monolithic pixel matrices which can be operated standalone. One of these two matrices has been characterised at beam test before and after irradiation with protons and neutrons. Results demonstrated the feasibility of producing radiation hard large area fully monolithic pixel sensors in HV-CMOS technology. H35DEMO chips with a substrate resistivity of 200$\u03a9$ cm irradiated with neutrons showed a radiation hardness up to a fluence of $10^{15}$n$_{eq}$cm$^{-2}$ with a hit efficiency of about 99% and a noise occupancy lower than $10^{-6}$ hits in a LHC bunch crossing of 25ns at 150V.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07817","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T12:32:02Z","registered":"2022-03-01T12:32:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T12:32:04Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Observation of high-energy neutrinos along with the MeV neutrinos from SNe will provide unprecedented opportunities to understand unanswered questions in cosmic-ray and neutrino physics. We show that current and future neutrino detectors can identify high-energy neutrinos from an extragalactic SN in the neighborhood of the Milky Way. We present the prospects for detecting high-energy neutrino minibursts from SNe in known local galaxies, and demonstrate how the network of multiple high-energy neutrino detectors will extend the horizon for the identification of high-energy SN neutrinos.

Owing to the high aspect ratio of many proteins, ellipsoidal raspberry colloid particles were constructed and reproduced the geometric resistance factors of Perrin and of Happel and Brenner in the laboratory-frame and in the moving body-frame.

Thermal fluctuations are due to the quantized nature of the energy exchanges between the clusters, the gas, and the radiation field. Nanoscale effects modify the spontaneous detachment of monomers due to the finite amount of internal energy contained in small clusters. We find that both corrections have a big impact on the stability of the clusters and on the rate of nucleation. We implement our model within a Monte Carlo code to derive the new stability conditions for clusters as well as nucleation rates. Due to computing limitations, we can explore the consequences of this approach only at high temperatures, at which particle interactions are not much less frequent than photon interactions. We found that the combined effect of the detachment correction and the temperature fluctuations produces faster nucleation. We also found that the nucleation rate depends on the composition of the gas and not only on the partial pressure of the compound that condensates into grains. This is a unique result of this model that can be used to prove or disprove it.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5726","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T20:42:18Z","registered":"2022-03-13T20:42:19Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T20:42:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Commonly, spectral and temporal profiles of \u03b3-ray emission are analysed. However, they are insufficient for a complete picture on GRB-related physics. The addition of polarization measurements provides invaluable information towards the understanding of these astrophysical sources. In recent years, dedicated polarimeters, such as POLAR and GAP, were built. The former of which observed low levels of polarization as well as a temporal evolution of the polarization angle. It was understood that a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements and time resolved studies are necessary to constrain theoretical models. The POLAR-2 mission aims to address this by increasing the effective area by an order of magnitude compared to POLAR. POLAR-2 is manifested for launch on board the China Space Station in 2024 and will operate for at least 2 years. Insight from POLAR will aid in the improvement of the overall POLAR-2 design. Major improvements (compared to POLAR) will include the replacement of multi-anode PMTs (MAPMTs) with SiPMs, increase in sensitive volume and further technological upgrades. POLAR-2 is projected to measure about 50 GRBs per year with equal or better quality compared to the best seen by POLAR. The instrument design, preliminary results and anticipated scientific potential of this mission will be discussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03084","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T21:55:03Z","registered":"2022-02-23T21:55:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T21:55:04Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We present a search for a radio counterpart to the gravitational-wave source GW190425, a BNS merger, using Apertif on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). We observe a field of high probability in the associated localisation region for 3 epochs at 68, 90 and 109 days post merger. We identify all sources that exhibit flux variations consistent with the expected afterglow emission of GW190425. We also look for possible transients. These are sources which are only present in one epoch. In addition, we quantify our ability to search for radio afterglows in fourth and future observing runs of the gravitational-wave detector network using Monte Carlo simulations. We found 25 afterglow candidates based on their variability. None of these could be associated with a possible host galaxy at the luminosity distance of GW190425. We also found 55 transient afterglow candidates that were only detected in one epoch. All turned out to be image artefacts. In the fourth observing run, we predict that up to three afterglows will be detectable by Apertif. While we did not find a source related to the afterglow emission of GW190425, the search validates our methods for future searches of radio afterglows.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04280","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T21:23:59Z","registered":"2022-02-21T21:24:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T21:24:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the Early Universe, in particular during inflation and reheating, this instability can be triggered leading to catastrophic vacuum decay. We discuss how the large spacetime curvature of the Early Universe can be incorporated in the calculation and in many cases significantly modify the flat space prediction. The two key new elements are the unavoidable generation of the non-minimal coupling between the Higgs field and the scalar curvature of gravity and a curvature induced contribution to the running of the constants. For the minimal set up of the Standard Model and a decoupled inflation sector we show how a metastable vacuum can lead to very tight bounds for the non-minimal coupling. We also discuss a novel and very much related dark matter generation mechanism.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

Even though there exists adequate documentation regarding programmatic postures and innovations, difficulties persist within the physics discipline. In this paper, we present innovative, programmatic implementations over an eight-year period at an undergraduate, liberal arts physics program. Some of these innovations accord with nationally-published, `best practices' for undergraduate physics programs, while others are novel to the program's context. Within this eight-year period, alterations are separated into curricular, co-curricular, and experiential elements. Innovations are introduced in some detail, and data are presented before, during, and after their introduction. While it is currently impossible to say which elements had the greatest impact, the synergistic combination did have a positive effect on the program. Not only did the number of total majors and graduates increase, there was a 200% increase of women degree recipients compared to the previous ten years, which boosted average graduation rates above the national average (30% &gt; 20%). Women were retained within the undergraduate physics major at a higher percentage during this time period when compared to men in the program. Lastly, these women physics majors maintained careers in science advancement fields at a rate of ~90% after $\\leq5$ years post-graduation. While this paper presents a singular case study, the purpose is two-fold: a) to validate quantitatively the work of national physics organizations within the context of a liberal arts institution, and b) to suggest that a multi-level approach is most efficacious when considering programmatic innovations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages, 8 figures, accepted in Frontiers in Education, section STEM Education (23/02/23)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13776","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-20T06:36:37Z","registered":"2022-02-20T06:36:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-02-27T01:59:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here, we show how this is possible by studying photocurrent generation for a single core-shell p-i-n junction GaAs nanowire solar cell grown on a silicon substrate. At one sun illumination a short circuit current of 180 mA/cm^2 is obtained, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than what would be predicted from Lambert-Beer law. The enhanced light absorption is shown to be due to a light concentrating property of the standing nanowire as shown by photocurrent maps of the device. The results imply new limits for the maximum efficiency obtainable with III-V based nanowire solar cells under one sun illumination.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1068","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T01:19:31Z","registered":"2022-03-11T01:19:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T01:19:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We find that the contribution to the overall H$\u03b1$ luminosity is approximately equal for the HII and DIG regions.

Metallicity gradients are measured using five different metallicity diagnostics at each resolution. We find that all metallicity diagnostics used are affected by the inclusion of DIG to varying degrees. We discuss the reasons of why the metallicity gradients are significantly affected by DIG using the HII dominance and emission line ratio radial profiles. We find that applying the [SII]/H$\u03b1$ cut will provide a closer estimate of the true metallicity gradient up to a resolution of 1005 pc for all metallicity diagnostics used in this study.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"26 pages, 12 figures + Appendix/Supplementary Material, accepted for publication by MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03251","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T19:45:15Z","registered":"2022-02-27T19:45:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T19:45:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The $\u03d5^6$ and $\u03d5^{10}$ potentials can yield either oscillatory or non-oscillatory evolution, and we use the first integrals to determine how the initial conditions map onto each form of evolution.

One postulates that these are itinerant weakly correlated metallic systems that become magnetic by virtue of spin-Peierls type transition due to near-nesting between the hole and the electron Fermi surface pockets. The other argues these materials are strongly or at least moderately correlated, the electrons are considerably localized and close to a Mott-Hubbard transition, with the local magnetic moments interacting via short-range superexchange. In this paper we argue that neither picture is fully correct. The systems are moderately correlated, but with correlations driven by Hund's rule coupling rather than by the on-site Hubbard repulsion. The iron moments are largely local, driven by Hund's intra-atomic exchange. Superexchange is not operative and the interactions between the Fe moments are considerably long-range and driven mostly by one-electron energies of all occupied states.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3857","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T18:20:53Z","registered":"2022-03-15T18:20:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T18:20:53Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Multi-scale context information for semantic segmentation is crucial for dealing with diverse sizes and shapes of target objects in the given scene. Conventional multi-scale context scheme adopts multiple effective receptive fields by multiple dilation rates or pooling operations, but often suffer from misalignment problem with respect to the target pixel.

Although existing partition detection methods in arbitrary graphs tolerate unreliable networks, they either assume that all nodes are correct or that a limited number of nodes might crash. In particular, Byzantine behaviors are out of the scope of these algorithms despite Byzantine fault tolerance being an active research topic for important problems such as consensus. Moreover, Byzantinetolerant protocols, such as broadcast or consensus, always rely on the assumption of connected networks. This paper addresses the problem of detecting partition in Byzantine networks (without connectivity assumption). We present a novel algorithm, which we call NECTAR, that safely detects partitioned and possibly partitionable networks and prove its correctness. NECTAR allows all correct nodes to detect whether a network could suffer from Byzantine nodes. We evaluate NECTAR's performance and compare it to two existing baselines using up to 100 nodes running real code, on various realistic topologies. Our results confirm that NECTAR maintains a 100% accuracy while the accuracy of the various existing baselines decreases by at least 40% as soon as one participant is Byzantine. Although NECTAR's network cost increases with the number of nodes and decreases with the network's diameter, it does not go above around 500KB in the worst cases.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14814","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-08-28T01:49:16Z","registered":"2024-08-28T01:49:17Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-08-28T01:49:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To achieve that, a consistent calculation up to nf-proportional NNLO contributions to both the hard-scattering amplitude and the perturbatively calculable part of the pion distribution amplitude has been performed. By combining and matching the results obtained for these two amplitudes, a proper cancellation of collinear singularities has been established and the gamma5 ambiguity problem (related to the use of the dimensional regularization method) has been resolved by using the naive-gamma5 as well as the 't Hooft-Veltman (HV) schemes. It has been demonstrated that the prediction for the pion transition form factor is independent of the factorization scale muF at every order in the strong coupling constant, making it possible to use the simplest choice muF^2=Q^2 at the intermediate steps of the calculation. Assuming the pion asymptotic distribution amplitude and working in the \\bar{MS} scheme, we have found the BLM scale to be muR^2=muBLM^2 ~ Q^2/9. Based on the same distribution, the complete NLO prediction for the pion transition form factor has been calculated in the alphaV definition of the QCD coupling renormalized at muR^2=muV^2 = e^{5/3} muBLM^2 ~ Q^2/2. It is in good agreement with the presently available experimental data.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"35 pages, 11 figures; revised: (v2) minor changes in the text; (v3) only some typos corrected","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0107295","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T09:15:50Z","registered":"2022-03-19T09:15:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T09:15:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Since the outburst, the water maser emission toward MM1 has substantially weakened. Simultaneously, the strong water masers associated with the synchrotron continuum point source CM2 have flared by a mean factor of 6.5 (to 4.2 kJy) with highly-blueshifted features (up to 70 km/s from LSR) becoming more prominent. The strongest flaring water masers reside 3000 au north of MM1B and form a remarkable bow shock pattern whose vertex coincides with CM2 and tail points back to MM1B. Excited OH masers trace a secondary bow shock located ~120 au downstream. ALMA images of CS (6-5) reveal a highly-collimated north-south structure encompassing the flaring masers to the north and the non-flaring masers to the south seen in projection toward the MM3-UCHII region. Proper motions of the southern water masers over 5.3 years indicate a bulk projected motion of 117 km/s southward from MM1B with a dynamical time of 170 yr. We conclude that CM2, the water masers, and many of the excited OH masers trace the interaction of the high velocity bipolar outflow from MM1B with ambient molecular gas. The previously-excavated outflow cavity has apparently allowed the radiative energy of the current outburst to propagate freely until terminating at the northern bow shock where it strengthened the masers. Additionally, water masers have been detected toward MM7 for the first time, and a highly-collimated CS (6-5) outflow has been detected toward MM4.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication by The Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04178","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T20:13:08Z","registered":"2022-03-01T20:13:09Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T20:13:09Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This allows for sterile neutrinos to be a dark matter candidate. In this scenario, the dynamical masses and energy densities of active and sterile neutrinos can be consistently embedded into the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG), the unified dark sector model. In addition, dark matter adiabatically coupled to dark energy allows for a natural decoupling of the (active) mass varying neutrino (MaVaN) component from the dark sector. Thus MaVaN's turn into a secondary effect. Through the scale parameters, $\u03be$ and $s$, the proposed scenario allows for a convergence among three distinct frameworks: the cosmon scenario, the seesaw mechanism for mass generation and the GCG model. It is found that the equation of state of the perturbations is the very one of the GCG background cosmology so that all the results from this approach are maintained, being smoothly modified by active neutrinos. Constrained by the seesaw relations, it is shown that the mass varying mechanism is responsible for the stability against linear perturbations and is indirectly related to the late time cosmological acceleration.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"24 pages, 6 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0830","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-15T14:25:15Z","registered":"2022-03-15T14:25:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-15T14:25:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This procedure is usually interpreted as an {\\it ad hoc} imposition on the unimodular theory's structure. Whereas the consequences of avoiding the conservation of the total energy-momentum tensor has been already introduced in the literature, it has been not widely explored so far. We study an expanding universe sourced by a single effective perfect fluid such that the null divergence of its energy-momentum tensor is not imposed. As we shall show, in this scheme, the unimodular theory has its own conservation equation obtained from the Bianchi identities. We explore the evolution of the homogeneous and isotropic expanding background and show that a viable cosmological scenario exists. Also, we consider scalar perturbations with particular attention given to the gauge issue. We show that contrary to the traditional unimodular theory where the synchronous and longitudinal (newtonian) gauge for cosmological perturbations are not permitted, if the conservation of the energy-momentum is relaxed the scalar perturbations in the synchronous condition survive and present a growing mode behavior. We study therefore a new cosmological scenario in which the dynamics of the universe transits from the radiative phase directly to a accelerated one but allowing thus for structure formation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 1 figure","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06644","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-19T06:36:34Z","registered":"2022-02-19T06:36:35Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-06-30T01:22:08Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Unlike the usual procedure, suitable for infinite or externally bound systems, they are determined as expectation values of appropriate intrinsic operators, dependent on the relative coordinates and momenta (Jacobi variables) and acting on intrinsic wavefunctions of nuclear states. Thus, translational invariance (TI) is respected. When handling such intrinsic quantities, we use an algebraic technique based upon the Cartesian representation, in which the coordinate and momentum operators are linear combinations of the creation and annihilation operators a^+ and a for oscillator quanta. Each of the relevant multiplicative operators can then be reduced to the form: one exponential of the set {a^+} times other exponential of the set {a}. In the course of such a normal-ordering procedure we offer a fresh look at the appearance of \"Tassie-Barker\" factors, and point out other model-independent results. The intrinsic wavefunction of the nucleus in its ground state is constructed from a nontranslationally-invariant (nTI) one via existing projection techniques. As an illustration, the one-body and two-body momentum distributions (MDs) for the 4He nucleus are calculated with the Slater determinant of the harmonic-oscillator model as the trial, nTI wavefunction. We find that the TI introduces important effects in the MDs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, incl. 3 figures - to appear in Eur. Phys. J.

We show that, in the typical regimes in which the application of multilayer shallow water models is justified, the resulting discretization does not introduce any major spurious feature and allows again to reduce substantially the computational cost in areas with complex bathymetry.

Our images probe the rest-frame optical light where stars are expected to dominate the galaxy luminosity. The rest-frame UV light of eight of these galaxies demonstrates the well-known ``alignment effect''. Most of the radio galaxies have rounder, more symmetric morphologies at rest-frame optical wavelengths. Here we show the most direct evidence that in most cases the stellar hosts are normal elliptical galaxies with de Vaucouleurs law light profiles. For a few galaxies very faint traces of the UV-bright aligned component are also visible in the infrared images. We derive both the effective radius and surface-brightness for nine of eleven sample galaxies by fitting surface-brightness models to them. We find their sizes are similar to those of local FRII radio source hosts and are in general larger than other local galaxies. The derived host galaxy luminosities are very high and lie at the bright end of luminosity functions constructed at similar redshifts. The galaxies in our sample are also brighter than the rest-frame size--surface-brightness locus defined by the low-redshift sources. Passive evolution roughly aligns the z ~ 1 galaxies with the low-redshift samples. The optical host is sometimes centered on a local minimum in the rest-frame UV emission, suggesting the presence of substantial dust obscuration. We also see good evidence of nuclear point sources in three galaxies. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that these galaxies have already formed the bulk of their stars at redshifts greater than z &gt;~ 2, and that the AGN phenomenon takes place within otherwise normal, perhaps passively evolving, galaxies.

First-principles path-integral computations are carried out, providing essentially exact numerical results on the thermodynamic properties. The theoretical model used here provides a realistic and remarkably general framework for describing simple Bose systems ranging from crystals to normal fluids to superfluids and gases. The interplay between particle interactions on the one hand, quantum indistinguishability and delocalization on the other, is characterized by a single quantumness parameter, which can be tuned to engineer and explore different regimes. Taking advantage of the rare combination of the versatility of the many-body Hamiltonian and the possibility for exact computations, we systematically investigate the phases of the systems as a function of pressure (P) and temperature (T), as well as the quantumness parameter. We show how the topology of the phase diagram evolves from the known case of He-4, as the system is made more (and less) quantum, and compare our predictions with available results from mean-field theory. Possible realization and observation of the phases and physical regimes predicted here are discussed in various experimental systems, including hypothetical muonic matter.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03644","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T15:46:00Z","registered":"2022-02-25T15:46:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T15:46:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this paper, we investigate the local linear stability of differentially rotating, magnetized flows and the evolution of the magnetorotational instability beyond the weak-field limit. We show that, when superthermal toroidal fields are considered, the effects of both compressibility and magnetic tension forces, which are related to the curvature of toroidal field lines, should be taken fully into account. We demonstrate that the presence of a strong toroidal component in the magnetic field plays a non-trivial role. When strong fields are considered, the strength of the toroidal magnetic field not only modifies the growth rates of the unstable modes but also determines which modes are subject to instabilities. We find that, for rotating configurations with Keplerian laws, the magnetorotational instability is stabilized at low wavenumbers for toroidal Alfven speeds exceeding the geometric mean of the sound speed and the rotational speed. We discuss the significance of our findings for the stability of cold, magnetically dominated, rotating fluids and argue that, for these systems, the curvature of toroidal field lines cannot be neglected even when short wavelength perturbations are considered. We also comment on the implications of our results for the validity of shearing box simulations in which superthermal toroidal fields are generated.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"24 pages, 12 figures.

That is so because they are effective models of relevance and are interpretable by design. Despite their apparent compatibility with inverted indexes, however, retrieval over sparse embeddings remains challenging. That is due to the distributional differences between learned embeddings and term frequency-based lexical models of relevance such as BM25. Recognizing this challenge, a great deal of research has gone into, among other things, designing retrieval algorithms tailored to the properties of learned sparse representations, including approximate retrieval systems. In fact, this task featured prominently in the latest BigANN Challenge at NeurIPS 2023, where approximate algorithms were evaluated on a large benchmark dataset by throughput and recall. In this work, we propose a novel organization of the inverted index that enables fast yet effective approximate retrieval over learned sparse embeddings. Our approach organizes inverted lists into geometrically-cohesive blocks, each equipped with a summary vector. During query processing, we quickly determine if a block must be evaluated using the summaries. As we show experimentally, single-threaded query processing using our method, Seismic, reaches sub-millisecond per-query latency on various sparse embeddings of the MS MARCO dataset while maintaining high recall. Our results indicate that Seismic is one to two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art inverted index-based solutions and further outperforms the winning (graph-based) submissions to the BigANN Challenge by a significant margin.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18812","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-04-30T02:43:01Z","registered":"2024-04-30T02:43:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-07-15T01:55:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This makes it extremely difficult to understand and model their properties at a quantitative level, and thus effective structure-property relations are challenging to obtain. Cu$_{2-x}$Se is an intensely studied, cheap and non-toxic high performance thermoelectric, which exhibits highly peculiar transport properties, especially around the $\u03b2$ to $\u03b1$ phase transition around 400 K, which must be related to the detailed nature of the crystal structure. Attempts to solve the crystal structure of the low temperature phase, $\u03b2$-Cu$_{2-x}$Se, have been unsuccessful since 1936. So far all studies have assumed that $\u03b2$-Cu$_{2-x}$Se has a three-dimensional periodic structure, but here we show that the structure is ordered only in two dimensions while being disordered in the third dimension with a highly disordered stacking sequence. Using the three-dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D-$\u0394$PDF) analysis method for diffuse single crystal X-ray scattering, we solve the structure of the ordered layer and show that there are two modes of stacking disorder present, which give rise to an average structure with higher symmetry. The present approach allows for a direct solution of structures with disorder in some dimensions and order in others. The local and extended structure of a solid determines its properties and Cu$_{2-x}$Se represents an example of a high-performing thermoelectric material where the local atomic structure differs significantly from the average periodic structure observed from Bragg crystallography.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12092","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T14:41:10Z","registered":"2022-03-01T14:41:11Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T14:41:11Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

If the information disseminated is accurate, for example, maximizing its distribution is desirable, whereas if it is a rumor or a virus, its spread should be minimized. In this context, it is very important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize propagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained momentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of nodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality measures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this study, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of nodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model and only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes according to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm is named the Expected Value Estimation (EVE). We compared the performance of EVE, using different SIR settings on real datasets, with that of many current well-known centrality measures. The experimental studies demonstrated that the solution quality (ranking capability) of EVE is superior to that of its competitors.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"There was a minor inaccuracy in coefficient calculation for a competitor centrality measure named as Convex Combinations of Centrality Measures.

Though described only by one-dimensional strings of binary cells evolving according to nearest-neighbour update rules, certain ECA rules manifest complex dynamics capable of universal computation. Yet, the classification of precisely which rules exhibit complex behaviour remains a significant challenge. Here we approach this question using tools from quantum stochastic modelling, where quantum statistical memory -- the memory required to model a stochastic process using a class of quantum machines -- can be used to quantify the structure of a stochastic process. By viewing ECA rules as transformations of stochastic patterns, we ask: Does an ECA generate structure as quantified by the quantum statistical memory, and if so, how quickly? We illustrate how the growth of this measure over time correctly distinguishes simple ECA from complex counterparts. Moreover, it provides a more refined means for quantitatively identifying complex ECAs -- providing a spectrum on which we can rank the complexity of ECA by the rate in which they generate structure.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, 9 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14053","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-23T03:26:36Z","registered":"2022-02-23T03:26:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-03-21T02:19:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Being an enabling technique, the wide applications of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) heavily relies on efficient implementations balancing both performance and complexity. However, most of the existing detectors uniformly quantize all variables, resulting in high redundancy and low flexibility. Requiring both expertise and efforts, an in-depth tailored quantization usually asks for prohibitive costs and is not considered by conventional MIMO detectors. In this paper, a general framework named the automatic hybrid-precision quantization (AHPQ) is proposed with two parts: integral quantization determined by probability density function (PDF), and fractional quantization by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Being automatic, AHPQ demonstrates high efficiency in figuring out good quantizations for a set of algorithmic parameters. For the approximate message passing (AMP) detector, AHPQ achieves up to $58.7\\%$ lower average bitwidth than the unified quantization (UQ) one with almost no performance sacrifice. The feasibility of AHPQ has been verified by implementation with $65$ nm CMOS technology. Compared with its UQ counterpart, AHPQ exhibits $2.97\\times$ higher throughput-to-area ratio (TAR) with $19.3\\%$ lower energy dissipation. Moreover, by node compression and strength reduction, the AHPQ detector outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOA) in both throughput ($17.92$ Gb/s) and energy efficiency ($7.93$ pJ/b). The proposed AHPQ framework is also applicable for other digital signal processing algorithms.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05880","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-08-12T00:50:21Z","registered":"2022-08-12T00:50:21Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-04-27T01:13:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this study, we focus on two typical interacting dynamical dark energy models, i.e., the interacting $w$ cold dark matter (I$w$CDM) model and the interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) model. To avoid the large-scale instability problem in IDE models, we apply the parameterized post-Friedmann approach to calculate the perturbation of dark energy. We employ the Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization data, combined with low-redshift measurements on baryon acoustic oscillation distance scales, type Ia supernovae, and the Hubble constant, to constrain the cosmological parameters. We find that the dark energy properties could influence the constraint limits on the total neutrino mass. Once dynamical dark energy is considered in the IDE models, the upper bounds of $\\sum m_\u03bd$ will be changed. By considering the values of $\u03c7^2_{\\rm min}$, we find that in these IDE models the normal hierarchy case is slightly preferred over the inverted hierarchy case; for example, $\u0394\u03c7^2=2.720$ is given in the IHDE+$\\sum m_\u03bd$ model. In addition, we also find that in the I$w$CDM+$\\sum m_\u03bd$ model $\u03b2=0$ is consistent with current observational data inside the 1$\u03c3$ range, and in the IHDE+$\\sum m_\u03bd$ model $\u03b2&gt;0$ is favored at more than 2$\u03c3$ level.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 3 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08848","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T18:29:48Z","registered":"2022-02-28T18:29:50Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T18:29:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here, we create a band inversion not of bulk states, but rather between manifolds of surface states. We realise this by aliovalent substitution of Nb for Zr and Sb for S in the ZrSiS family of nonsymmorphic semimetals. Using angle-resolved photoemission and density-functional theory, we show how two pairs of surface states, known from ZrSiS, are driven to intersect each other in the vicinity of the Fermi level in NbGeSb, as well as to develop pronounced spin-orbit mediated spin splittings. We demonstrate how mirror symmetry leads to protected crossing points in the resulting spin-orbital entangled surface band structure, thereby stabilising surface state analogues of three-dimensional Weyl points. More generally, our observations suggest new opportunities for engineering topologically and symmetry-protected states via band inversions of surface states.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"In press at Nature Communications.

We derive a K5 spectral type for T~54~A (which dominates the emission of the system) and an age of $\\sim$2~Myr. However, the dust disk properties of T~54 are consistent with those of debris disks seen around older and earlier-type stars. At the same time, T~54 has evidence of gas remaining in the disk as indicated by [Ne II], [Ne III], and [O I] line detections. We model the spectral energy distribution of T~54 and estimate that $\\sim$3$\\times$10$^{-3}$ Earth-masses of small dust grains ($$10~$\u03bc$m) grains within a circumprimary disk. Assuming a solar-like mixture, we use Ne line luminosities to place a minimum limit on the gas mass of the disk ($\\sim$3$\\times$10$^{-4}$ Earth-masses) and derive a gas-to-dust mass ratio of $\\sim$0.1. We do not detect substantial accretion, but we do see H$\u03b1$ in emission in one epoch, suggestive that there may be intermittent dumping of small amounts of matter onto the star. Considering the low dust mass, the presence of gas, and young age of T~54, we conclude that this system is on the bridge between the protoplanetary and debris disk stages.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05032","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T23:48:22Z","registered":"2022-03-03T23:48:22Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T23:48:22Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The gas is sometimes found at large distance (~10 kpc) from the center of a galaxy and is not necessarily centered on it. Similarly large quantities of ionized gas could be hidden in these systems as well. The properties of some of the gas reservoirs are similar to the median properties of the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs); two of the HI reservoirs are catalogued HVCs. The association of the HI with the dwarf spheroidals might thus provide a link between the HVCs and stars. We show that the HI content of the Local Group dSphs and dIrrs exhibits a sharp decline if the galaxy is within 250 kpc of either the Milky Way or M31. This can be explained if both galaxies have a sufficiently massive x-ray emitting halo that produces ram-pressure stripping if a dwarf ventures too close to either giant spiral. We also investigate tidal stripping of the dwarf galaxies and find that although it may play a role, it cannot explain the apparent total absence of neutral gas in most dSph galaxies at distances less than 250 kpc. For the derived mean density of the hot gas, n_0 = 2.5e-5 cm^-2, ram-pressure stripping is found to be more than an order of magnitude more effective in removing the gas from the dSph galaxies. The hot halo, with an inferred mass of 1e10 solar masses, may represent a reservoir of ~1000 destroyed dwarf systems, either HVCs or true dwarf galaxies similar to those we observe now.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"AASTex preprint style, 27 pages including 12 figures.

This effect is associated with the non-circular nature of the shells. It is, therefore, necessary to use the geometrical distance between ring centers.

Some of the most energetic occur on the periphery of active regions where the magnetic field is strongly inclined. These jets exhibit a non-radial propagation in the low corona as they follow the inclined field, and often have a broad, helical shape. We present a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of such an active-region-periphery helical jet. We consider an initially potential field with a bipolar flux distribution embedded in a highly inclined magnetic field, representative of the field nearby an active region. The flux of the minority polarity sits below a bald-patch separatrix initially. Surface motions are used to inject free energy into the closed field beneath the separatrix, forming a sigmoidal flux rope which eventually erupts producing a helical jet. We find that a null point replaces the bald patch early in the evolution and that the eruption results from a combination of magnetic breakout and an ideal kinking of the erupting flux rope. We discuss how the two mechanisms are coupled, and compare our results with previous simulations of coronal-hole jets. This comparison supports the hypothesis that the generic mechanism for all coronal jets is a coupling between breakout reconnection and an ideal instability. We further show that our results are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with observations of active-region periphery jets.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 15 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09423","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T09:41:31Z","registered":"2022-02-27T09:41:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T09:41:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Efficient Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) that generalizes well across different morphing techniques is, therefore, of paramount importance. Existing MAD techniques predominantly rely on discriminative models that learn from examples of bona fide and morphed images and, as a result, often exhibit sub-optimal generalization performance when confronted with unknown types of morphing attacks. To address this problem, we propose a novel, diffusion-based MAD method in this paper that learns only from the characteristics of bona fide images. Various forms of morphing attacks are then detected by our model as out-of-distribution samples. We perform rigorous experiments over four different datasets (CASIA-WebFace, FRLL-Morphs, FERET-Morphs and FRGC-Morphs) and compare the proposed solution to both discriminatively-trained and once-class MAD models. The experimental results show that our MAD model achieves highly competitive results on all considered datasets.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Published at IWBF 2023","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15733","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-06-29T01:45:25Z","registered":"2023-06-29T01:45:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-06-29T01:45:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The spectrum shows numerous emission lines in the soft X-ray band from highly ionized ions, as well as Compton reflection and fluorescent lines from neutral or near-neutral matter. We analyze the spectrum in the context of a self-consistent recombination cascade model and find that a nearly flat differential emission measure (DEM) distribution in ionization parameter fits the data. For a fixed solid angle distribution of matter surrounding a point source, this corresponds to a run of electron density of the form, n(r) ~ r^(-3/2), which is suggestive of Bondi accretion onto a central compact mass. Using this density profile and comparing the resulting emission spectra with the ASCA data, the size of the X-ray emission line region is estimated to be &lt; 1 kpc. We also show that the derived density as a function of radius is compatible with the X-ray recombination line emission region being the confining medium of the coronal line regions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"21 pages including 8 figures and 4 tables; accepted for publication to the Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0006146","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T15:49:36Z","registered":"2022-03-21T15:49:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T15:49:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Notably, the solitonic boson star can reach higher compactness, which one might expect could alter the dynamics in this context. Our findings suggest that even when the black hole's size approaches the test particle limit, the solitonic boson star is easily captured by the black hole due to an extreme tidal capture process.

While the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) inferred from the three data sets are approximately the same, the corresponding high-density symmetry energies at densities above about $2\u03c1_0$ are very different, indicating that the radii of massive NSs carry reliable information about the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy with little influence from the remaining uncertainties of the SNM EOS.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Added the Subsection 3.6.

A paramount model of the non-equilibrium critical behavior is the directed bond percolation process that exhibits an active- to-absorbing state phase transition in the vicinity of a percolation threshold. Fluctuations of the ambient environment might affect or destroy the universality properties completely. In this work we assume that the random environment can be described by means of compressible velocity fluctu- ations. Using field-theoretic models and renormalization group methods we investigate large-scale and long-time behavior. Altogether eleven universality classes are found, out of which four are stable in the infrared limit and thus macroscopically accessible. In contrast to the model without veloc- ity fluctuations a possible candidate for a realistic three-dimensional case, a regime with relevant short-range noise, is identified. Depending on the dimensionality of space and the structure of the turbulent flow we calculate critical exponents of the directed percolation process. In the limit of the purely transversal velocity field random force critical exponents comply with the incompressible results obtained by previous authors. We have found intriguing non-universal behavior related to the mutual effect of compressibility and advection.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02036","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T16:41:21Z","registered":"2022-03-02T16:41:21Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T16:41:21Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Further we will provide arguments for the nature of the transitions between the regimes.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4 pages, 2 figures, proceedings of 9th International Workshop on the Physics of Nonideal Plasmas, Rostock, Germany, September 1999","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9910010","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T18:40:24Z","registered":"2022-03-20T18:40:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T18:40:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We pay particular attention to the role of many-body localization and the approach to thermalization, which currently are topics of considerable interest, as they pertain to the very foundations of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. We employ local-mode (valence) coordinates and consider initial excitations localized in one local mode, with energies ranging from low to near the dissociation threshold, where the classical dynamics have been shown to be chaotic. We propagate the nuclear wavepacket on the potential energy surface by means of the numerically exact multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method and employ mean local energies, time-dependent and time-averaged populations in quantum number space, energy distributions, entanglement entropies, local population distributions, microcanonical averages, and dissociation probabilities, as diagnostic tools. This allows us to identify a continuous localization $\\rightarrow$ delocalization transition in the energy flow, associated with the onset of quantum chaos, as the excitation energy increases up to near the dissociation threshold. Moreover, we find that at this energy and $\\sim$1 ps the molecule nearly thermalizes. Furthermore, we observe that IVR is so slow that the molecule begins to dissociate well before such quasi-thermalization is complete, in accordance with earlier classical-mechanical predictions of non-RRKM behavior.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 11 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01912","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T09:46:22Z","registered":"2022-03-03T09:46:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T09:46:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Unlike traditional methods, Basilisk does not resort to stacking the kinematics of satellite galaxies in bins of central luminosity, and does not make use of summary statistics, such as satellite velocity dispersion. Rather, Basilisk leaves the data in its raw form and computes the corresponding likelihood. In addition, Basilisk can be applied to flux-limited, rather than volume-limited samples, greatly enhancing the quantity and dynamic range of the data. And finally, Basilisk is the only available method that simultaneously solves for halo mass and orbital anisotropy of the satellite galaxies, while properly accounting for scatter in the galaxy-halo connection. Basilisk uses the conditional luminosity function to model halo occupation statistics, and assumes that satellite galaxies are a relaxed tracer population of the host halo's potential with kinematics that obey the spherical Jeans equation. We test and validate Basilisk using mocks of varying complexity, and demonstrate that it yields unbiased constraints on the galaxy-halo connection and at a precision that rivals galaxy-galaxy lensing. In particular, Basilisk accurately recovers the full PDF of the relation between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity, and simultaneously constrains the orbital anisotropy of the satellite galaxies. Basilisk's inference is not affected by potential velocity bias of the central galaxies, or by slight errors in the inferred, radial profile of satellite galaxies that arise as a consequence of interlopers and sample impurity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07547","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T05:30:54Z","registered":"2022-02-27T05:30:55Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T05:30:55Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) is proven valuable as a second or concurrent reader in this context. However, accurate detection of lung nodules remains a challenge for such CAD systems and even radiologists due to not only the variability in size, location, and appearance of lung nodules but also the complexity of lung structures. This leads to a high false-positive rate with CAD, compromising its clinical efficacy. Motivated by recent computer vision techniques, here we present a self-supervised region-based 3D transformer model to identify lung nodules among a set of candidate regions. Specifically, a 3D vision transformer (ViT) is developed that divides a CT image volume into a sequence of non-overlap cubes, extracts embedding features from each cube with an embedding layer, and analyzes all embedding features with a self-attention mechanism for the prediction. To effectively train the transformer model on a relatively small dataset, the region-based contrastive learning method is used to boost the performance by pre-training the 3D transformer with public CT images. Our experiments show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of lung nodule screening in comparison with the commonly used 3D convolutional neural networks.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00122","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-05-03T01:39:31Z","registered":"2022-05-03T01:39:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-10-20T01:16:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The electric and magnetic susceptibility tensors of the material system may vary from point to point in space, but they cannot be functions of time. In the case of spatially non-dispersive media, the only other constraint on the local susceptibility tensors is that they be symmetric at each and every point. The proof is readily extended to media that exhibit spatial dispersion: For reciprocity to hold, the electric susceptibility tensor Chi_E_mn that relates the complex-valued magnitude of the electric dipole at location r_m to the strength of the electric field at r_n must be the transpose of Chi_E_nm. Similarly, the necessary and sufficient condition for the magnetic susceptibility tensor is Chi_M_mn = Chi^T_M_nm.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 2 figures, 28 equations, 21 references","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5894","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T22:59:05Z","registered":"2022-03-12T22:59:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T22:59:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The performance of 2D image classification networks is constantly improving and being trained on databases made of millions of natural images. However, progress in medical image analysis has been hindered by limited annotated data and acquisition constraints. These limitations are even more pronounced given the volumetry of medical imaging data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient way to transfer the efficiency of a 2D classification network trained on natural images to 2D, 3D uni- and multi-modal medical image segmentation applications. In this direction, we designed novel architectures based on two key principles: weight transfer by embedding a 2D pre-trained encoder into a higher dimensional U-Net, and dimensional transfer by expanding a 2D segmentation network into a higher dimension one. The proposed networks were tested on benchmarks comprising different modalities: MR, CT, and ultrasound images. Our 2D network ranked first on the CAMUS challenge dedicated to echo-cardiographic data segmentation and surpassed the state-of-the-art. Regarding 2D/3D MR and CT abdominal images from the CHAOS challenge, our approach largely outperformed the other 2D-based methods described in the challenge paper on Dice, RAVD, ASSD, and MSSD scores and ranked third on the online evaluation platform. Our 3D network applied to the BraTS 2022 competition also achieved promising results, reaching an average Dice score of 91.69% (91.22%) for the whole tumor, 83.23% (84.77%) for the tumor core, and 81.75% (83.88%) for enhanced tumor using the approach based on weight (dimensional) transfer. Experimental and qualitative results illustrate the effectiveness of our methods for multi-dimensional medical image segmentation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables, Accepted for publication in the Journal of Medical Image Analysis","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15872","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-08-01T01:44:42Z","registered":"2023-08-01T01:44:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-08-01T01:44:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Spin-orbit coupling is a powerful tool in ultracold atomic systems, resulting in an artificial gauge field that can be easily manipulated and observed in a tabletop environment. Combining optical Raman lattices and atom-atom interaction, the artificial gauge field can be made density-dependent. In this work, we propose a straightforward way to engineer one-dimensional density-dependent gauge field in a Bose-Hubbard model in spin-orbit coupled Raman lattices. Next, we study the model from two perspectives: few-body quantum walk dynamics and many-body ground state. In the first perspective, we show that large spin-flipped tunneling can lead to a deep two-body bound state. In the second perspective, mean-field and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations consistently reveal three different phases, i.e. the Mott insulator phase, the superfluid phase, and the magnetic superfluid phase. Finally, we discuss the experimental protocol with Raman lattices based on existing experimental platforms.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Phys. Rev.

At low driving velocities, sliding occurs via propagation of periodic self-healing slip pulses whose velocity is limited by collective diffusion of the gel network. Healing can be attributed to a frictional instability occurring at the slip velocity $v = V_c$. For $v &gt; V_c$, sliding is homogeneous and friction is ruled by the shear-thinning rheology of an interfacial layer of thickness of order the (nanometric) mesh size, containing a semi-dilute solution of polymer chain ends hanging from the network. Inspite of its high degree of confinement, the rheology of this system does not differ qualitatively from known bulk ones. The observed ageing of the static friction threshold reveals the slow increase of adhesive bonding between chain ends and glass. Such structural ageing is compatible with the existence of a velocity-weakening regime at velocities smaller than $V_c$, hence with the existence of the healing instability.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 16 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0303129","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T16:56:17Z","registered":"2022-03-18T16:56:19Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T16:56:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These include, among others, transcription factor activation by phosphorylation and acetylation, formation of active complexes with one or more co-factors, and mRNA/protein degradation and stabilization processes. This paper presents a first step towards the systematic, genome-wide computational inference of genes that modulate the interactions of specific transcription factors at the post-transcriptional level. The method uses a statistical test based on changes in the mutual information between a transcription factor and each of its candidate targets, conditional on the expression of a third gene. The approach was first validated on a synthetic network model, and then tested in the context of a mammalian cellular system. By analyzing 254 microarray expression profiles of normal and tumor related human B lymphocytes, we investigated the post transcriptional modulators of the MYC proto-oncogene, an important transcription factor involved in tumorigenesis. Our method discovered a set of 100 putative modulator genes, responsible for modulating 205 regulatory relationships between MYC and its targets. The set is significantly enriched in molecules with function consistent with their activities as modulators of cellular interactions, recapitulates established MYC regulation pathways, and provides a notable repertoire of novel regulators of MYC function. The approach has broad applicability and can be used to discover modulators of any other transcription factor, provided that adequate expression profile data are available.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables; minor changes following referees' comments; accepted to RECOMB06","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0510030","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T22:46:32Z","registered":"2022-03-17T22:46:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T22:46:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is well-known that dendrite orientation results from the growth competition between the heat flow direction and preferred crystallographic orientation. Specifically, the competition between interfacial anisotropy and process anisotropy (thermal gradient and growth velocity) during directional solidification leads to rich morphological diversity of the resulting dendritic structures, including tilted dendrites and seaweed patterns. The orientation selection mechanisms of such patterns remain unexplored at high velocity in the frame of AM. This study examines the tilted growth of cellular-dendritic arrays as a function of the misorientation angle ($\u03b8_R$) between the thermal gradient and crystal lattice directions and other relevant control parameters. We use a phase-field model to explore dendritic evolution in a binary alloy during high-velocity solidification in 2D. We find marked effects of thermal gradient, growth velocity, alloy composition, and anisotropy parameters on the possible growth directions and the primary arm spacing, constitutional undercooling, microsegregation, and secondary phases that arise during dendritic solidification. Our work provides a detailed yet concise presentation on the tilted growth and morphological transition for a broad range of thermal conditions in the high-velocity regime and the full range of $\u03b8_R$ for establishing orientation selection maps. These results should have qualitative relevance for controlling the subgrain structure, chemical segregation, and texture randomization in commercial dendrite materials relevant to AM.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08346","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2025-01-16T02:27:52Z","registered":"2025-01-16T02:27:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-01-16T02:27:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We approach this topic from the point of view of geometry encoded in the quantum geometric tensor, which describes the complexity of adiabatic transformations. In particular, we consider two generic models of spin chains that are parameterized by two independent couplings. In one, the integrability breaking perturbation is global while, in the other, integrability is broken only at the boundary. In both cases, the shortest paths in the coupling space lead towards integrable regions and we argue that this behavior is generic. These regions thus act as attractors of adiabatic flows similar to river basins in nature. Physically, the directions towards integrable regions are characterized by faster relaxation dynamics than those parallel to integrability, and the anisotropy between them diverges in the thermodynamic limit as the system approaches the integrable point. We also provide evidence that the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior is universal for both models, similar to continuous phase transitions, and that the model with local integrability breaking quickly becomes chaotic but avoids ergodicity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 20 figures; Phys.

These performance measures are shown to be linked to the stationary distribution of an underlying irreducible Markov chain that models the system exactly.

The work then presents two iterative schemes to approximate the steady-state distribution of node occupancies by decoupling the chain to smaller queueing blocks. These approximate solutions are used to understand the effect of buffer sizes on throughput capacity and the distribution of packet delay. Using the exact modeling for line networks, it is shown that the throughput capacity is unaltered in the absence of hop-by-hop feedback provided packet-level network coding is allowed. Finally, using simulations, it is confirmed that the proposed framework yields accurate estimates of the throughput capacity and delay distribution and captures the vital trends and tradeoffs in these networks.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 14 figures, accepted in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2628","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T18:46:19Z","registered":"2022-03-13T18:46:20Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T18:46:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Observationally, white light observations have recorded many occurrences of a thin ray appearing behind a CME eruption that closely resembles a post-CME CS in its spatial correspondence and morphology. UV and X-ray observations further strengthen this interpretation by the observations of high temperature emission at locations consistent with model predictions. The next question then becomes whether the properties inside a post-CME CS predicted by a model agree with observed properties. In this work, we assume that the post-CME CS is a consequence of Petschek-like reconnection and that the observed ray-like structure is bounded by a pair of slow mode shocks developed from the reconnection site. We perform time-dependent ionization calculations and model the UV line emission. We find that such a model is consistent with SOHO/UVCS observations of the post-CME CS. The change of Fe XVIII emission in one event implies an inflow speed of ~10 km/s and a corresponding reconnection rate of M_A ~ 0.01. We calculate the expected X-ray emission for comparison with X-ray observations by Hinode/XRT, as well as the ionic charge states as would be measured in-situ at 1 AU. We find that the predicted count rate for Hinode/XRT agree with what was observed in a post-CME CS on April 9, 2008, and the predicted ionic charge states are consistent with high ionization states commonly measured in the interplanetary CMEs. The model results depend strongly on the physical parameters in the ambient corona, namely the coronal magnetic field, the electron density and temperature during the CME event. It is crucial to obtain these ambient coronal parameters and as many facets of the CS properties as possible by observational means so that the post-CME current sheet models can be scrutinized more effectively.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1732","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T00:05:41Z","registered":"2022-03-14T00:05:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T00:05:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

As an application we solve the evolution equation for second-order tensor perturbations on large scales for a constant equation of state and we use the matching conditions to evolve the solutions through the transition from an inflationary era to a radiation era. We show that in the radiation era the resulting free part of the large-scale tensor perturbation (constant mode) is slow-roll suppressed in both the uniform-density and Poisson gauges.

In this case mobile species can diffuse over long distances through the fast phase in the time scale of diffusion in the slow phase. At macroscopic scale, contrasted phase diffusivities lead to a memory effect that cannot be properly described by classical Fick's second law. Here we obtain effective governing equations through a two-scale approach for composite materials consisting of a fast matrix and slow inclusions. The micro-macro transition is similar to first-order computational homogenisation, and involves the solution of a transient diffusion boundary-value problem in a Representative Volume Element of the microstructure. Different from computational homogenisation, we propose a semi-analytical mean-field estimate of the composite response based on the exact solution for a single inclusion developed in our previous work [Brassart, L., Stainier, L., 2018. Effective transient behaviour of inclusions in diffusion problems. Z. Angew Math. Mech. 98, 981-998]. A key outcome of the model is that the macroscopic concentration is not one-to-one related to the macroscopic chemical potential, but obeys a local kinetic equation associated with diffusion in the slow phase. The history-dependent macroscopic response admits a representation based on internal variables, enabling efficient time integration. We show that the local chemical kinetics can result in non-Fickian behaviour in macroscale boundary-value problems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"36 pages, 14 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08710","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T08:58:36Z","registered":"2022-03-01T08:58:37Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T08:58:37Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Square-net materials with clean, linearly dispersing bands show potential to circumvent this issue. CeSbTe, a square-net material, features multiple magnetic field-controllable topological phases. Here, it is shown that in this material, even higher degrees of tunability can be achieved by changing the electron count at the square-net motif. Increased electron filling results in structural distortion and formation of charge density waves (CDWs). The modulation wave-vector evolves continuously leading to a region of multiple discrete CDWs and a corresponding complex \"Devil's staircase\" magnetic ground state. A series of fractionally quantized magnetization plateaus are observed, which implies direct coupling between CDW and a collective spin-excitation. It is further shown that the CDW creates a robust idealized non-symmorphic Dirac semimetal, thus providing access to topological systems with rich magnetism.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 15 figures, Revised version to appear in Advanced Materials","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06883","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-21T10:58:04Z","registered":"2022-02-21T10:58:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-21T10:58:04Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We compute this multivariate probability distribution for various classes of single-field slow-roll models, exploring its dependence on the characteristic inflationary energy scales, the shape of the potential V and and the choice of measure underlying the calculation. We find that unless the characteristic scale Delta-phi on which V varies happens to be near the Planck scale, the only aspect of V that matters observationally is the statistical distribution of its peaks and troughs. For all energy scales and plausible measures considered, we obtain the predictions Omega_tot ~ 1+-0.00001, w=-1 and rho_Lambda in the observed ballpark but uncomfortably high. The high energy limit predicts n_s ~ 0.96, dn_s/dlnk ~ -0.0006, r ~ 0.15 and n_t ~ -0.02, consistent with observational data and indistinguishable from eternal phi^2-inflation. The low-energy limit predicts 5 parameters but prefers larger Q and redder n_s than observed. We discuss the coolness problem, the smoothness problem and the pothole paradox, which severely limit the viable class of models and measures. Our findings bode well for detecting an inflationary gravitational wave signature with future CMB polarization experiments, with the arguably best-motivated single-field models favoring the detectable level r ~ 0.03.

The recent realization of this phenomenon - the quantum anomalous Hall effect - provides a conceptually new platform for studies of edge-state transport, distinct from the more extensively studied integer and fractional quantum Hall effects that arise from Landau level formation. An important question arises in this context: how do these 1D edge states evolve as the magnetization is changed from out-of-plane to in-plane? We examine this question by studying the field-tilt driven crossover from predominantly edge state transport to diffusive transport in Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films, as the system transitions from a quantum anomalous Hall insulator to a gapless, ferromagnetic topological insulator. The crossover manifests itself in a giant, electrically tunable anisotropic magnetoresistance that we explain using the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. Our methodology provides a powerful means of quantifying edge state contributions to transport in temperature and chemical potential regimes far from perfect quantization.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03556","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T04:33:13Z","registered":"2022-03-08T04:33:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T04:33:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Most of existing entanglement distribution protocols do not consider purification, which is thus delegated to an upper layer. This is a major drawback since, once an end-to-end entangled connection (or a portion thereof) is established it cannot be purified if its fidelity (F) does not fall within an interval bounded by Fmin (greater than 0.5) and Fmax (less than 1). In this paper, we propose the Ranked Entanglement Distribution Protocol (REDiP), a connection-oriented protocol that overcomes the above drawback. This result was achieved by including in our protocol two mechanisms for carrying out jointly purification and entanglement swapping. We use simulations to investigate the impact of these mechanisms on the performance of a repeater network, in terms of throughput and fidelity. Moreover, we show how REDiP can easily be configured to implement custom entanglement swapping and purification strategies, including (but not restricted to) those adopted in two recent works.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication at IEEE ICC 2023","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14045","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-11-28T02:20:03Z","registered":"2022-11-28T02:20:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-11-03T01:33:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental.

First, the theoretical aspects of the non-thermal emission from early-type stars will be addressed. The main topics that will be discussed are respectively the physics of individual stellar winds and their interaction in binary systems, the acceleration of relativistic electrons, the magnetic field of massive stars, and finally the non-thermal emission processes relevant to the case of massive stars. Second, this general qualitative discussion will be followed by a more quantitative one, devoted to the most probable scenario where non-thermal radio emitters are massive binaries. I will show how several stellar, wind and orbital parameters can be combined in order to make some semi-quantitative predictions on the high-energy counterpart to the non-thermal emission detected in the radio domain. These theoretical considerations will be followed by a census of results obtained so far, and related to this topic...

In this paper, the physical features, such as rod contour length and polydispersity have been determined for both viruses. The effect of viral rod flexibility on the location of the nematic-smectic phase transition has been investigated, with a focus on the underlying dynamics studied more specifically in the smectic phase. Direct visualization of the stiff fd-Y21M at the scale of a single particle has shown the mass transport between adjacent smectic layers, as found earlier for the more flexible rods. We could relate this hindered diffusion with the smectic ordering potentials for varying rod concentrations. The self-diffusion within the layers is far more pronounced for the stiff rods as compared to the more flexible fd-wt viral rod.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5430","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T03:45:31Z","registered":"2022-03-11T03:45:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T03:45:32Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We find that there exists a whole family of F-statistic metrics, parametrized by the (unknown) amplitude parameters of the gravitational wave. The multi-detector metric is shown to be expressible in terms of noise-weighted averages of single-detector contributions, which implies that the number of templates required to cover the parameter space does not scale with the number of detectors. Contrary to using a longer observation time, combining detectors of similar sensitivity is therefore the computationally cheapest way to improve the sensitivity of coherent wide-parameter searches for continuous gravitational waves. We explicitly compute the F-statistic metric family for signals from isolated spinning neutron stars, and we numerically evaluate the quality of different metric approximations in a Monte-Carlo study. The metric predictions are tested against the measured mismatches and we identify regimes in which the local metric is no longer a good description of the parameter-space structure.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 15 figures, revtex4; v2: some edits of style and notation, fixed minor typos","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0606088","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T02:58:11Z","registered":"2022-03-17T02:58:13Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T02:58:13Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Our approach yields controls in a feedback form, where the policy function is given by a neural network (NN). Specifically, we fuse the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) approaches by parameterizing the value function with an NN. Our approach enables us to obtain approximately optimal controls in real-time without having to solve an optimization problem. Once the policy function is trained, generating a control at a given space-time location takes milliseconds; in contrast, efficient nonlinear programming methods typically perform the same task in seconds. We train the NN offline using the objective function of the control problem and penalty terms that enforce the HJB equations. Therefore, our training algorithm does not involve data generated by another algorithm. By training on a distribution of initial states, we ensure the controls' optimality on a large portion of the state-space. Our grid-free approach scales efficiently to dimensions where grids become impractical or infeasible. We apply our approach to several multi-agent collision-avoidance problems in up to 150 dimensions. Furthermore, we empirically observe that the number of parameters in our approach scales linearly with the dimension of the control problem, thereby mitigating the curse of dimensionality.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 12 figures.

Previously, it has been shown that for all eight materials, the Casalini-Roland thermodynamical scaling, /tau_{/alpha} = f(TV_{sp}^{/gamma}) (where T is temperature and V_{sp} is specific volume), (Casalini, R.; Roland, C. M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014, 113 (8), 85701), is satisfied. It has also been previously shown that the same scaling emerges naturally (for sufficiently low pressures) within the 'SL-TS2' framework (Ginzburg, V. V. Soft Matter 2021, 17, 9094). Here, we fit the ambient pressure curves for the relaxation time and the specific volume as functions of temperature for the eight materials and observe a good agreement between theory and experiment. We then use the Casalini-Roland scaling to convert those results into 'master curves', thus enabling predictions of relaxation times and specific volumes at elevated pressures.

However, in the context of facial analysis, existing XAI approaches, such as pixel attribution methods, offer explanations for individual images, posing challenges in assessing the overall behavior of a model, which would require labor-intensive manual inspection of a very large number of instances and leaving to the human the task of drawing a general impression of the model behavior from the individual outputs. Addressing this limitation, we introduce FaceX, the first method that provides a comprehensive understanding of face attribute classifiers through summary model explanations. Specifically, FaceX leverages the presence of distinct regions across all facial images to compute a region-level aggregation of model activations, allowing for the visualization of the model's region attribution across 19 predefined regions of interest in facial images, such as hair, ears, or skin. Beyond spatial explanations, FaceX enhances interpretability by visualizing specific image patches with the highest impact on the model's decisions for each facial region within a test benchmark. Through extensive evaluation in various experimental setups, including scenarios with or without intentional biases and mitigation efforts on four benchmarks, namely CelebA, FairFace, CelebAMask-HQ, and Racial Faces in the Wild, FaceX demonstrates high effectiveness in identifying the models' biases.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07313","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-12-11T03:03:48Z","registered":"2024-12-11T03:03:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-12-11T03:03:50Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The formalism is derived analytically based on the combination of Floquet theory and Born-Markov master equation. The formalism allows us to calculate the spectrum when the Floquet states and quasienergies are analytically or numerically solved for simple or complicated driving fields. We can systematically explore the spectral features by implementing the present formalism. To exemplify this theory, we apply the unified formalism to comprehensively study a generic model that a harmonically driven TLS is simultaneously coupled to a radiative reservoir and a dephasing reservoir. We demonstrate that the significant features of the fluorescence spectra, the driving-induced asymmetry and the dephasing-induced asymmetry, can be attributed to the violation of detailed balance condition, and explained in terms of the driving-related transition quantities between Floquet-states and their steady populations. In addition, we find the distinguished features of the fluorescence spectra under the biharmonic and multiharmonic driving fields in contrast with that of the harmonic driving case. In the case of the biharmonic driving, we find that the spectra is significantly different from the result of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) under the multiple resonance conditions. By the three concrete applications, we illustrate that the present formalism provides a routine tool for comprehensively exploring the fluorescence spectrum of periodically strongly driven TLSs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, 13 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00734","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T17:40:45Z","registered":"2022-03-06T17:40:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T17:40:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here we give a pedagogical introduction based on the canonical ensemble and apply it explicitly to ideal sedimentation. The relevant mathematical objects, such as the free energy, are viewed as functionals. This vantage point allows for systematic functional differentiation and the resulting identities express properties of both macroscopic average forces and molecularly resolved correlations in many-body systems, both in and out-of-equilibrium, and for active Brownian particles. To provide further background, we briefly describe the variational principles of classical density functional theory, of power functional theory, and of classical mechanics.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 3 figures, J.

We assume that the dispersion relation associated to the elastic coupling constants of the wave-equation is acoustic, i.e., it has a singularity of the type |k| near the vanishing wave vector, k=0. To derive equations that describe the macroscopic energy transport we introduce the Wigner transform and change variables so that the spatial and temporal scales are of the order of epsilon. In the continuum limit, which is achieved by sending the parameter epsilon to 0, the Wigner transform disintegrates into three different limit objects: the transform of the weak limit, the H-measure and the Wigner-measure. We demonstrate that these three limit objects satisfy a set of decoupled transport equations: a wave-equation for the weak limit of the rescaled initial data, a dispersive transport equation for the regular limiting Wigner measure, and a geometric optics transport equation for the H-measure limit of the initial data concentrating to k=0. A simple consequence of our result is the complete characterization of energy transport in harmonic lattices with acoustic dispersion relations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"34 pages, 2 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0611052","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T00:51:15Z","registered":"2022-03-17T00:51:18Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T00:51:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A number of large-scale replication projects have been conducted to gauge the overall reproducibility in specific academic fields. Here, we present an analysis of data from four studies which sought to forecast the outcomes of replication projects in the social and behavioural sciences, using human experts who participated in prediction markets and answered surveys. Because the number of findings replicated and predicted in each individual study was small, pooling the data offers an opportunity to evaluate hypotheses regarding the performance of prediction markets and surveys at a higher power. In total, peer beliefs were elicited for the replication outcomes of 103 published findings. We find there is information within the scientific community about the replicability of scientific findings, and that both surveys and prediction markets can be used to elicit and aggregate this information. Our results show prediction markets can determine the outcomes of direct replications with 73% accuracy (n=103). Both the prediction market prices and the average survey responses are correlated with outcomes (0.581 and 0.564 respectively, both p &lt; .001). We also found a significant relationship between p-values of the original findings and replication outcomes. The dataset is made available through the R package pooledmaRket and can be used to further study community beliefs towards replications outcomes as elicited in the surveys and prediction markets.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 Pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00517","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T02:23:05Z","registered":"2022-02-23T02:23:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T02:23:07Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

As a consequence, in a relevant range (which we call the Lyuksyutov regime) of parameters of the model we show that even without the norm constraint isotropic melting is anyway avoided in the energy minimizing configurations. Finally, we describe a class of boundary data including radial anchoring which yield in both the previous situations as minimizers smooth configurations whose level sets of the biaxiality carry nontrivial topology. Results in this paper will be largely employed and refined in the next papers of our series. In particular, in [DMP2], we will prove that for smooth minimizers in a restricted class of axially symmetric configurations, the level sets of the biaxiality are generically finite union of tori of revolution.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Improved presentation.

Our analysis uses newly acquired WFC3/IR imaging data from the CANDELS Multi-Cycle Treasury program over the GOODS South field. These new data are combined with existing deep optical ACS imaging to search for relatively bright (M_UV &lt; -19.5 mag) z~8 galaxy candidates using the Lyman Break technique. These new candidates are used to determine the bright end of the UV luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies at z~8. To minimize contamination from lower redshift galaxies, we make full use of all optical ACS data and impose strict non-detection criteria based on an optical chi^2_opt flux measurement. In the whole search area we identify 16 candidate z~8 galaxies, spanning a magnitude range H_160 = 25.7-27.9 mag. The new data show that the UV LF is a factor ~1.7x lower at M_UV &lt; -19.5 mag than determined from the HUDF09 and ERS data alone. Combining this new sample with the previous candidates from the HUDF09 and ERS data allows us to perform the most accurate measurement of the z~8 UV LF yet. Schechter function fits to the combined data result in a best-fit characteristic magnitude of M*(z=8) = -20.04+-0.46 mag. The faint-end slope is very steep, though quite uncertain, with alpha = -2.06+-0.32. A combination of wide area data with additional ultra-deep imaging will be required to significantly reduce the uncertainties on these parameters in the future.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, 12 figures; ApJ in press","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0755","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T00:21:20Z","registered":"2022-03-13T00:21:21Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T00:21:21Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, most existing deep learning-based methods still suffer from the coarse-grained details. In general, these algorithms are incapable of felicitously distinguishing the degree of exploration between deterministic domains (certain FG and BG pixels) and undetermined domains (uncertain in-between pixels), or inevitably lose information in the continuous sampling process, leading to a sub-optimal result. In this paper, we propose a novel network named Prior-Induced Information Alignment Matting Network (PIIAMatting), which can efficiently model the distinction of pixel-wise response maps and the correlation of layer-wise feature maps. It mainly consists of a Dynamic Gaussian Modulation mechanism (DGM) and an Information Alignment strategy (IA). Specifically, the DGM can dynamically acquire a pixel-wise domain response map learned from the prior distribution. The response map can present the relationship between the opacity variation and the convergence process during training. On the other hand, the IA comprises an Information Match Module (IMM) and an Information Aggregation Module (IAM), jointly scheduled to match and aggregate the adjacent layer-wise features adaptively. Besides, we also develop a Multi-Scale Refinement (MSR) module to integrate multi-scale receptive field information at the refinement stage to recover the fluctuating appearance details. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PIIAMatting performs favourably against state-of-the-art image matting methods on the Alphamatting.com, Composition-1K and Distinctions-646 dataset.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"IEEE TMM","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14439","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T09:31:46Z","registered":"2022-02-23T09:31:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T09:31:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The model assumes a massive and young stellar cluster surrounded by a large collection of clouds. These are thus exposed to the most important star-formation feedback mechanisms: photoionization and the cluster wind. The models show how the two feedback mechanisms compete with each other in the disruption of clouds and lead to two different hydrodynamic solutions: The storage of clouds into a long lasting ragged shell that inhibits the expansion of the thermalized wind, and the steady filtering of the shocked wind gas through channels carved within the cloud stratum that results into the creation of large-scale superbubbles. Both solutions are here claimed to be concurrently at work in giant HII regions and HII galaxies, causing their detailed inner structure.

Some bacteria express, on their surface, attachment organelles (pili) that comprise subunits formed into stiff helix-like structures that possess unique biomechanical properties. These helix-like structures possess a high degree of flexibility that gives the biopolymers a unique extendibility. This has been considered beneficial for piliated bacteria adhering to host surfaces in the presence of a fluid flow. We show in this work that helix-like pili have the ability to act as efficient dampers of force that can, for a limited time, lower the load on the force-mediating adhesin-receptor bond on the tip of an individual pilus. The model presented is applied to bacteria adhering with a single pilus of either of the two most common types expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, P or type 1 pili, subjected to realistic flows. The results indicate that for moderate flows (~25 mm/s) the force experienced by the adhesin-receptor interaction at the tip of the pilus can be reduced by a factor of ~6 and ~4, respectively. The uncoiling ability provides a bacterium with a \"go with the flow\" possibility that acts as a damping. It is surmised that this can be an important factor for the initial part of the adhesion process, in particular in turbulent flows, and thereby be of use for bacteria in their striving to survive a natural defense such as fluid rinsing actions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7586","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T21:13:04Z","registered":"2022-03-08T21:13:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T21:13:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Starting from the time-frequency evolution and total emitted energy of their reported candidate, we show that such an emission is not compatible with the current understanding of neutron stars. We explore the additional required physical assumptions to make a full waveform model, for example, taking the optimistic emission from a spining-down neutron star with fixed quadrupolar deformation, and study whether even an ideal single-template matched-filter analysis could detect an ideal, fully phase-coherent signal. We find that even in the most optimistic case an increase in energy and extreme parameters would be required for a confident detection with LIGO sensitivity as of 2018-08-17. The argument also holds for other waveform models following a similar time-frequency track and overall energy budget. Single-template matched filtering on the LIGO data around GW170817, and on data with added simulated signals, verifies the expected sensitivity scaling and the overall statistical expectation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 6 figures, updated version as accepted by MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06724","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T11:08:01Z","registered":"2022-03-01T11:08:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-10-07T01:09:15Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The models consisted of a 4-arm rotor mounted on a shaft above a 2-arm (scissor) rotor with all the rotor arms having a rectangular cross section. The relative phase between the 2- and 4-arm rotors was either $0\u00b0$ (in-phase) or $45\u00b0$ (out-of-phase). The rotors were oriented at zero angle-of-attack and rotated at 30 Hz. Their wakes were measured with particle-image-velocimetry within a water tunnel at a hub diameter based Reynolds number of $820,000$ and an advance ratio of $0.2$. Mean profiles, fluctuating profiles and spectral analysis using time-series analysis as well as dynamic mode decomposition were used to characterize the wake and identify coherent structures associated with specific frequency content. The canonical geometry produced coherent structures that were consistent with previous results using more complex geometries. It was shown that the dominant structures (2 and 4 times per hub revolution) decay slowly and were not sensitive to the relative phase between the rotors. Conversely, the next strongest structure (6 times per hub revolution) was sensitive to the relative phase with almost no coherence observed for the in-phase model. This is strong evidence that the 6 per revolution content is a nonlinear interaction between the 2 and 4 revolution structures. This study demonstrates that the far wake region is dominated by the main rotor arms wake, the scissor rotor wake and interactions between these two features.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"In consideration for publication in Experiments in Fluids","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03892","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T04:53:58Z","registered":"2022-03-02T04:53:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T04:53:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, video clips usually contain large amounts of data and pose a high cost in terms of computational resources and thus may complicate the SE system. As an alternative source, a bone-conducted speech signal has a moderate data size while manifesting speech-phoneme structures, and thus complements its air-conducted counterpart. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal SE structure in the time domain that leverages bone- and air-conducted signals. In addition, we examine two ensemble-learning-based strategies, early fusion (EF) and late fusion (LF), to integrate the two types of speech signals, and adopt a deep learning-based fully convolutional network to conduct the enhancement. The experiment results on the Mandarin corpus indicate that this newly presented multi-modal (integrating bone- and air-conducted signals) SE structure significantly outperforms the single-source SE counterparts (with a bone- or air-conducted signal only) in various speech evaluation metrics. In addition, the adoption of an LF strategy other than an EF in this novel SE multi-modal structure achieves better results.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"multi-modal, bone/air-conducted signals, speech enhancement, fully convolutional network","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09847","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T09:21:09Z","registered":"2022-02-27T09:21:11Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T09:21:11Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The evolution of residual stress in the Al layer during isothermal annealing is evaluated using X-ray diffraction based technique to ascertain the role of stress in the ALILE process. A corroboration of the stress with the growth kinetics, analyzed using Avrami theory of phase transformation gives a comprehensive understanding of the ALILE crystallization process in this system. The grown polycrystalline SiGe thin film is a potential candidate for novel technological applications in semiconductor devices.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"24 pages, 11 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02986","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T19:32:53Z","registered":"2022-02-27T19:32:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T19:32:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

It is shown that obliquely propagating (OP) low-frequency (in comparison with the negative-ion cyclotron frequency) long-wavelength \"slow\" and \"fast\" modes can propagate, respectively, as dust ion-acoustic (DIA) and dust ion-cyclotron (DIC)-like waves. The properties of these modes are studied with the effects of obliqueness of propagation $(\u03b8)$, the static magnetic field, the ratios of the negative to positive ion masses $(m)$ and temperatures $(T)$ as well as the dust to negative-ion number density ratio $(\u03b4)$. Using the standard reductive perturbation technique, we derive a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation which governs the evolution of small-amplitude OP DIA waves. It is found that the KdV equation admits only rarefactive solitons in plasmas with $m$ well below its critical value $m_c~(\\gg1)$ which typically depends on $T$ and $\u03b4$. It is shown that the nonlinear coefficient of the KdV equation vanishes at $m=m_c$, i.e., for plasmas with much heavier negative ions, and the evolution of the DIA waves is then described by a modified KdV (mKdV) equation. The latter is shown to have only compressive soliton solution. The properties of both the KdV and mKdV solitons are studied with the system parameters as above, and possible applications of our results to laboratory and space plasmas are briefly discussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, 6 figures; to appear in Phys.

The point vortices evolve through their usual mutual advection but they experience in addition a random velocity and a systematic drift generated by the system as a whole. The statistical equilibrium state of this stochastic model is the Gibbs canonical distribution. We consider a single species system and a system made of two types of vortices with positive and negative circulations. At positive temperatures, like-sign vortices repel each other (plasma case) and at negative temperatures, like-sign vortices attract each other (gravity case). We derive the stochastic equation satisfied by the exact vorticity field and the Fokker-Planck equation satisfied by the N-body distribution function. We present the BBGKY-like hierarchy of equations satisfied by the reduced distribution functions and close the hierarchy by considering an expansion of the solutions in powers of 1/N, where N is the number of vortices, in a proper thermodynamic limit. For spatially inhomogeneous systems, we derive the kinetic equations satisfied by the smooth vorticity field in a mean field approximation valid for $N\\to +\\infty$. For spatially homogeneous systems, we study the two-body correlation function, in a Debye-H\u00fcckel approximation valid at the order O(1/N). The results of this paper can also apply to other systems of random walkers with long-range interactions such as self-gravitating Brownian particles and bacterial populations experiencing chemotaxis.

The physical scenario is that of a conical, magnetized plasma jet having a periodical (P1) increase of relativistic particles, Nrel, at a specific orbital phase, as predicted by accretion in the eccentric orbit of LSI+61303. Jet precession (P2) changes the angle, eta, between jet axis and line of sight, thereby inducing variable Doppler boosting. The problem is defined in spherical geometry, and the optical depth through the precessing jet is calculated by taking into account that the plasma is stratified along the jet axis. The synchrotron emission of such a jet was calculated and we fitted the resulting flux density Smodel(t) to the observed flux density obtained during a 6.5-year monitoring of LSI+61303 by the Green Bank radio interferometer. Our physical model for the system LSI+61303 is not only able to reproduce the long-term modulation in the radio emission, but it also reproduces all the other observed characteristics of the radio source, the orbital modulation of the outbursts, their orbital phase shift, and their spectral index properties. Moreover, a correspondence seems to exist between variations in the ejection angle induced by precession and the rapid rotation in position angle observed in VLBA images. We conclude that the peak of the long-term modulation occurs when the jet electron density is around its maximum and the approaching jet is forming the smallest possible angle with the line of sight. This coincidence of maximum number of emitting particles and maximum Doppler boosting of their emission occurs every 1667 days and creates the long-term modulation observed in LSI+61303.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3983","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T05:18:53Z","registered":"2022-03-10T05:18:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T05:18:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

All the galaxies feature shells distributed around their main bodies and are thus likely merger remnants. The color distribution of the globular clusters in all four galaxies shows a broad peak centered on g-I ~ 1.4, while PGC 6240 and PGC 42871 show a significant number of globular clusters with g-I ~ 1.0. The latter globular clusters are interpreted as being of age ~ 500 Myr and likely having been formed in the merger. The color of the redder peak is consistent with that expected for an old metal-poor population that is very commonly found around normal galaxies. However, all galaxies except PGC 10922 contain several globular clusters that are significantly brighter than the maximum luminosity expected of a single old metal-poor population. To test for multiple-age populations of overlapping g-I color, we model the luminosity functions of the globular clusters as composites of an old metal-poor subpopulation with a range of plausible specific frequencies and an intermediate-age subpopulation of solar metallicity. We find that three of the four sample galaxies show evidence for the presence of an intermediate-age (~ 1 Gyr) globular cluster population, in addition to the old metal-poor GC population seen in normal early-type galaxies. None of the galaxies show a significant population of clusters consistent with an old, metal-rich red cluster population that is typically seen in early-type galaxies.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"41 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in AJ.

However, six out of 31 excess sources in the Herschel OTKP DUNES have been seen to show significant - and in some cases extended - excess emission at 160\u03bcm, which is larger than the 100\u03bcm excess. This excess emission has been suggested to stem from debris disks colder than those known previously. Using several methods, we re-consider whether some or even all of the candidates may be associated with unrelated galactic or extragalactic emission and conclude that it is highly unlikely that none of the candidates represents a true circumstellar disk. For true disks, both the dust temperatures inferred from the SEDs and the disk radii estimated from the images suggest that the dust is nearly as cold as a blackbody. This requires the grains to be larger than ~100\u03bcm, regardless of their material composition. To explain the dearth of small grains, we explore several conceivable scenarios: transport-dominated disks, disks of low dynamical excitation, and disks of unstirred primordial macroscopic grains. Our qualitative analysis and collisional simulations rule out the first two of these scenarios, but show the feasibility of the third one. We show that such disks can survive for gigayears, largely preserving the primordial size distribution. They should be composed of macroscopic solids larger than millimeters, but smaller than kilometers in size. Thus planetesimal formation, at least in the outer regions of the systems, has stopped before \"cometary\" or \"asteroidal\" sizes were reached.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Astrophysical Journal (in press). 22 pages, 13 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2855","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T02:15:56Z","registered":"2022-03-11T02:15:57Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T02:15:57Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We discuss the phenomenological implications of the model analyzing mass values for the axion from the milli-eV to the MeV region.

As the predominant decay modes of the Higgs and Z bosons are to a pair of quarks, the analysis focuses on final states consisting of jets resulting from the six quarks produced in the events. Since the two jets produced in the decay of a highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs or Z boson can merge to form a single jet, nine independent analyses are performed, categorized by the number of observed jets and the reconstructed event mode. No signal in excess of the expected background is observed. Lower limits are set on the VLQ mass at 95% confidence level equal to 1570 GeV in the case where the VLQ decays exclusively to a b quark and a Higgs boson, 1390 GeV for when it decays exclusively to a b quark and a Z boson, and 1450 GeV for when it decays equally in these two modes.

Given the spatial distribution and spectrum of the ionizing sources, our formalism can be used to predict the large scale power spectra of fluctuations in the abundances of HII, HI and radiation. Our approach avoids common approximations/assumptions in existing analytic methods -- for instance, we do not assume a specific ionization topology from the outset; nor do we make a step-function bubble-like approximation to the HII distribution. Applying our formalism to sources biased according to the Press-Schechter prescription, we find: 1. reionization always proceeds ``inside--out'', with dense regions more highly ionized, at least on large scales; 2. on sufficiently large scales, HII, HI and radiation exhibits a scale independent bias relative to dark matter; 3. the bias is suppressed on scales comparable to or smaller than the mean free path of the ionizing photons; 4. if the ionizing source spectrum is sufficiently soft, the HII bias closely tracks the source bias for most of the reionization process but drops precipitously after percolation; 5. if the ionizing source spectrum is sufficiently hard, the HII bias drops in a more steady fashion throughout the reionization process. The tools developed here will be useful for interpreting future 21 cm, CMB and Lyman-alpha forest observations, both to learn about the reionization astrophysics (such as the hardness of the source spectrum and therefore the nature of the ionizing sources) and to possibly extract interesting cosmological information.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 10 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607628","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T21:35:31Z","registered":"2022-03-21T21:35:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T21:35:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Rev. Lett. 114, 250401 (2015)]. This has been probed through the quantum violations of CHSH inequality, i. e., when each observer performs two dichotomic measurements. In the present study we investigate how many Bobs can sequentially demonstrate bipartite nonlocality with a single Alice in the above scenario when the number of measurement settings per observer is increased. It is shown that at most two Bobs can exhibit bipartite nonlocality with a single Alice using local realist inequalities with three as well as four dichotomic measurements per observer. We then conjecture that the above feature remains unchanged contingent upon using local realist inequalities with $n$ dichotomic measurements per observer, where $n$ is arbitrary. We further present the robustness of bipartite nonlocality sharing in the above scenario against the entanglement and mixedness of the shared state.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Close to published version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04813","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T12:39:53Z","registered":"2022-03-01T12:39:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T12:39:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The resulting protection for the Z-&gt;b_L b_L and Z-&gt;\u03c4_R\u03c4_R decays allows for potentially interesting signals in Higgs physics, while maintaining the good agreement of the Standard Model with precision tests, without significant fine-tuning. Although being viable setups on their own, the models we study can particularly be motivated as the low energy effective theories of the composite Higgs models MCHM_5 and MCHM_10 or the corresponding gauge-Higgs unification models. The spectra can be identified with the light custodians present in these theories. These have the potential to describe the relevant physics in their fermion sectors in a simplified and transparent way. In contrast to previous studies of composite models, we consider the impact of a realistic lepton sector on the Higgs decays. We find significant modifications in the decays to \u03c4leptons and photons due to the new leptonic resonances. While from a pure low energy perspective an enhancement of the channel pp-&gt;h-&gt;\u03b3\u03b3turns out to be possible, if one considers constraints on the parameters from the full structure of the composite models, the decay mode into photons is always reduced. We also demonstrate that taking into account the non-linearity of the Higgs sector does not change the qualitative picture for the decays into \u03c4-leptons or photons in the case of the dominant Higgs production mechanism.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"33 pages, 12 figures; v2: typos corrected, references added, minor clarifying comments and discussion of new Moriond results added, version published in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5856","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T18:10:22Z","registered":"2022-03-11T18:10:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T18:10:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

With the BALs from different ions, the HV outflowing gas can be constrained to have a density n_H~10^10.3-10^11.4 cm^-3, a column density N_H~10^21 cm^-2 and an ionization parameter U~10^-1.83 - 10^-1.72; and thus inferring a distance of R_HV~0.5 pc from the central continuum source with a monochromatic luminosity of 7.0*10^45 erg/s at 5100 A. This distance is remarkable similar to that of normal broad emission line region (BLR) estimated according to the luminosity-distance from the reverberation experiments, suggesting the association between the BLR and the HV BAL outflowing gas. Interestingly enough, a blueshifted component is also significantly detected in Mg II and Al III broad emission lines (BELs), and the Al III/Mg II of such a BEL component can be reproduced by the physical parameters inferred from the HV BAL gas. The LV BAL gas very likely have a larger column density and a higher ionization level than the HV BAL gas, and hence a smaller distance than that of the latter. Further spectroscopy with high S/N ratio and broader wavelength coverage is needed to confirm this and shed new light on the possible connection between BALs and BELs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04193","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T22:48:50Z","registered":"2022-02-23T22:48:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T22:48:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

After describing the canonical decomposition of the action, we find an exact expression for the 3-body Hamiltonian, implicitly determined in terms of the four coordinate and momentum degrees of freedom in the system. Non-relativistically these degrees of freedom can be rewritten in terms of a single particle moving in a two-dimensional hexagonal well. We find the exact relativistic generalization of this potential, along with its post-Newtonian approximation. We then specialize to the equal mass case and numerically solve the equations of motion that follow from the Hamiltonian. Working in hexagonal-well coordinates, we obtaining orbits in both the hexagonal and 3-body representations of the system, and plot the Poincare sections as a function of the relativistic energy parameter $\u03b7$. We find two broad categories of periodic and quasi-periodic motions that we refer to as the annulus and pretzel patterns, as well as a set of chaotic motions that appear in the region of phase-space between these two types. Despite the high degree of non-linearity in the relativistic system, we find that the the global structure of its phase space remains qualitatively the same as its non-relativisitic counterpart for all values of $\u03b7$ that we could study. However the relativistic system has a weaker symmetry and so its Poincare section develops an asymmetric distortion that increases with increasing $\u03b7$. For the post-Newtonian system we find that it experiences a KAM breakdown for $\u03b7\\simeq 0.26$: above which the near integrable regions degenerate into chaos.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"latex, 65 pages, 36 figures, high-resolution figures available upon request","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0301099","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T22:18:03Z","registered":"2022-03-18T22:18:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T22:18:04Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The onset of absorption, band I and also band IV, is resolved into broad vibrational peaks, which contrast with the continuous absorption previously claimed. A new theoretical analysis, using a combination of time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations and complete active space self-consistent field, leads to a major new interpretation. Adiabatic excitation energies (AEEs) and vertical excitation energies, evaluated by these methods, are used to interpret the spectra in unprecedented detail using theoretical vibronic analysis. This includes both Franck-Condon (FC) and Herzberg-Teller (HT) effects on cold and hot bands. These results lead to the re-assignment of several known excited states and the identification of new ones. The lowest calculated AEE sequence for singlet states is 1$^1$B$_1$ $\\sim$ 1$^1$A$_2$ &lt; 2$^1$B$_1$ &lt; 1$^1$A$_1$ &lt; 2$^1$A$_1$ &lt; 1$^1$B$_2$ &lt; 3$^1$A$_1$ &lt; 3$^1$B$_1$. These, together with calculated higher energy states, give a satisfactory account of the principal maxima observed in the VUV spectrum. Basis sets up to quadruple zeta valence with extensive polarization are used. The diffuse functions within this type of basis generate both valence and low-lying Rydberg excited states. The optimum position for the site of further diffuse functions in the calculations of Rydberg states is shown to lie on the H-atoms. The routine choice on the F-atoms is shown to be inadequate for both CHF$_3$ and CH$_2$F$_2$. The lowest excitation energy region has mixed valence and Rydberg character. TDDFT calculations show that the unusual structure of the onset arises from the near degeneracy of 1$^1$B$_1$ and 1$^1$A$_2$ valence states, which mix in symmetric and antisymmetric combinations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Manuscript and Supporting Material","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13354","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-07-26T01:37:02Z","registered":"2023-07-26T01:37:02Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-07-26T01:37:02Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Thus, to predict consumer decisions to adopt mobile banking, it is useful to understand the pattern of adoption of Internet banking (IB). This investigation seeks contribute to an expansion of the knowledge regarding this matter by researching Portuguese consumers patterns and behaviors concerning the acceptance and use intention of IB as a foundation for establishing growth strategies of mobile banking. For data collection, we used an online snowball process. The statistical treatment used included a factor analysis in order to allow examination of the interrelationships between the original variables. The analysis was made possible by developing a set of factors that expresses the common traits between them. The results revealed that the majority of respondents did not identify problems with the use of and interaction with the IB service. The study generated some interesting findings. First, the data generally supports the conceptual framework presented. However, some points need to be made: trust and convenience, from all the elements referenced in the literature as relevant from the client perspective, continue to be a very important elements; the results did not support the paradigm that the characteristics of individuals affect their behavior as consumers, individual technological characteristics affect consumer adoption of IB service; consumer perceptions about the IB service affect their use, as reveal by the existence of three types of customers that show different practices and perceptions of IB; and intention to use IB is dependent upon attitudes and subjective norms regarding the use of IB.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3141","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-10T04:56:59Z","registered":"2022-03-10T04:57:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-10T04:57:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We then move to a global description, using the methodology of stochastic inflation and the in-in path integral formalism. This approach shows clearly that the tunneling process becomes strongly coupled whenever the sound speed of the tunneling trajectory departs sufficiently from unity.

A center negative polarity was surrounded by several positive ones, and there appeared three FRs. The three FRs showed apparent slipping motions, and hook structures formed at their ends. Due to the moving footpoints of the erupting structures, one tight semi-circular hook disappeared after the slippage along its inner and outer edge, and coronal dimmings formed within the hook. The east hook also faded as a result of the magnetic reconnection between the arcades of a remote filament and a hot loop that was impulsively heated by the under flare loops. Our results are accordant with the slipping magnetic reconnection regime in 3D standard model for eruptive flares. We suggest that complex structures of the flare is likely a consequence of the more complex flux distribution in the photosphere, and the eruption involves at least two magnetic reconnections.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04982","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T20:14:03Z","registered":"2022-03-06T20:14:04Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T20:14:04Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We consider in detail two different scaling limits of the PD metric. The first of these limits removes the acceleration parameter, and leads to the Carter-Plebanski solution. In this case, the integrability conditions for Killing spinors were obtained by Alonso-Alberca, Meessen and Ortin in hep-th/0003071, and we show that these are not only necessary, but also sufficient for the existence of Killing spinors. This fills also a gap in hep-th/9808097, where the integrability conditions for supersymmetry of the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole were worked out, but the Killing spinor was not constructed explicitely. The second scaling limit eliminates the rotation parameter, and leads to the cosmological C-metric, which describes accelerated black holes in AdS. Also in this case, the supersymmetry conditions are obtained, and it is shown that they follow from the ones of the general PD solution by scaling the parameters appropriately. In all cases, we determine the three-dimensional base space that appears in the classification scheme of hep-th/0307022, and prove that for the 1/2-supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS spacetime, this base is unique. A Wick-rotation of our results leads to gravitational instantons that generalize the ones constructed recently by Martelli, Passias and Sparks in arXiv:12124618 to U(1)xU(1) symmetry. These instantons are shown to admit an integrable almost complex structure. Finally, our work may open the possibility to systematically construct generalizations of the PD metric that include scalar fields with a potential in matter-coupled gauged supergravity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, uses JHEP3.cls. v2: Refs. added, final version published in JHEP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3119","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T07:21:50Z","registered":"2022-03-11T07:21:51Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T07:21:51Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

One approach to pursue this direction is the utilization of laser interferometers equipped with the Fabry-Perot optical cavities in space. However, a number of challenges lie in this path practically. In particular, the implementation of precision control for the cavity lengths and the suppression of laser phase noises may prevent a practical detector design. To circumvent such difficulties, we propose a new interferometer topology, named the back-linked Fabry-Perot interferometer, where the precision length controls are not required and an offline subtraction scheme for laser phase noises is readily applicable. This article presents the principle idea and the associated sensitivity analyses. Despite additional noises, a strain sensitivity of $7\\times 10^{-23}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ may be attainable in the deci-Hertz band. Several technological developments and studies must be carried out to pave the way forward for the implementation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05483","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-24T11:18:31Z","registered":"2022-02-24T11:18:32Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-04-03T02:55:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We use a sample of data from the Moving Object Catalogue of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, together with spectra obtained from several surveys. A first sample of 349 observations, corresponding to 250 Trojan asteroids, were extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and we also extracted from the literature a second sample of 91 spectra, corresponding to 71 Trojans. The spectral slopes were computed by means of a least-squares fit to a straight line of the fluxes obtained from the Sloan observations in the first sample, and of the rebinned spectra in the second sample. In both cases the reflectance fluxes/spectra were renormalized to 1 at 6230 $\\textrm\u00c5$. We found that the distribution of spectral slopes among Trojan asteroids shows a bimodality. About 2/3 of the objects have reddish slopes compatible with D-type asteroids, while the remaining bodies show less reddish colors compatible with the P-type and C-type classifications. The members of asteroid families also show a bimodal distribution with a very slight predominance of D-type asteroids, but the background is clearly dominated by the D-types. The L4 and L5 swarms show different distributions of spectral slopes, and bimodality is only observed in L4. These differences can be attributed to the asteroid families since the backgraound asteroids show the same slope distribtuions in both swarms. The analysis of individual families indicates that the families in L5 are taxonomically homogeneous, but in L4 they show a mixture of taxonomic types. We discuss a few scenarios that might help to interpret these results.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"20 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0046","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T01:04:29Z","registered":"2022-03-21T01:04:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T01:04:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This model is characterized by a short, but violent, instability phase, during which the planets were on large eccentricity orbits. One characteristic of this model is that the proto-planetary disk must have been truncated at roughly 30 to 35 AU so that Neptune would stop migrating at its currently observed location. As a result, the Kuiper belt would have initially been empty. In this paper we present a new dynamical mechanism which can deliver objects from the region interior to ~35 AU to the Kuiper belt without excessive inclination excitation. Assuming that the last encounter with Uranus delivered Neptune onto a low-inclination orbit with a semi-major axis of ~27 AU and an eccentricity of ~0.3, and that subsequently Neptune's eccentricity damped in ~1 My, our simulations reproduce the main observed properties of the Kuiper belt at an unprecedented level.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0553","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T01:34:04Z","registered":"2022-03-21T01:34:05Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T01:34:05Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A dedicated experiment using the advanced technical installations of GSI, Darmstadt, permitted to realize ideal conditions for the investigation of relaxation effects in the meta-stable well. Combined with a highly sensitive experimental signature, it provides a measure of the transient effects with respect to the flux over the fission barrier. Within a two-step reaction process, 45 proton-rich unstable spherical isotopes produced by projectile-fragmentation of a stable 238U beam have been used as secondary projectiles. The fragmentation of the radioactive projectiles on lead results in nearly spherical compound nuclei which span a wide range in excitation energy and fissility. The decay of these excited systems by fission is studied with a dedicated set-up which permits the detection of both fission products in coincidence and the determination of their atomic numbers with high resolution. The width of the fission-fragment nuclear charge distribution is shown to be specifically sensitive to pre-saddle transient effects and is used to establish a clock for the passage of the saddle point. The comparison of the experimental results with model calculations points to a fission delay of (3.3+/-0.7).10-21s for initially spherical compound nuclei, independent of excitation energy and fissility. This value suggests a nuclear dissipation strength at small deformation of (4.5+/-0.5).1021s-1. The very specific combination of the physics and technical equipment exploited in this work sheds light on previous controversial conclusions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"38 pages, 15 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1094","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T05:04:27Z","registered":"2022-03-14T05:04:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T05:04:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Spectra were taken with HST/STIS through the 0.1X52 arcsec slit, covering the full STIS 1200 to 10000 Angstrom waveband, and are from a region that includes the hot spot, extending 0.2, or ~ 14 pc (for H= 75 km/sec/Mpc). Perhaps the most striking feature of these spectra is the presence of strong coronal emission lines, including [S XII] 7611 which has hitherto only been identified in spectra of the solar corona. There is an apparent correlation between ionization energy and velocity of the emission lines with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy, with the coronal lines blueshifted, most other high excitation lines near systemic, and some of the low ionization lines redshifted. From the results of our modeling, we find that the emission-line gas consists of three principal components: 1) one in which most of the strong emission-lines, such as [O III] 5007, [Ne V] 3426, C IV 1550, arise, 2) a more tenuous, highly ionized component, which is the source of the coronal-line emission, and 3) a component, which is not co-planar with the other two, in which the low ionization and neutral lines, such as [N II] 6548 and [O I] 6300, are formed. The first two components are directly ionized by the EUV-Xray continuum emitted by the central source, while the low ionization gas is ionized by a combination of highly absorbed continuum radiation and a small fraction of unabsorbed continuum scattered by free electrons associated with the hot spot. The combination of covering factor and Thomson optical depth of the high ionization components is insufficient to scatter the observed fraction of continuum radiation into our line-of-sight.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"42 pages, Latex, includes 5 figures (postscript), to appear in the Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9910548","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T21:23:58Z","registered":"2022-03-20T21:23:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T21:23:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We examine how the gravitational wave signal of a perturbed black hole is affected by such `dirtiness' within linear theory. As a concrete example, we consider the gravitational radiation emitted by the infall of a massive scalar field into a Schwarzschild black hole. Whereas part of the scalar field is absorbed/scattered by the black hole and triggers gravitational wave emission, another part lingers in long-lived quasi-bound states. Solving numerically the Teukolsky master equation for gravitational perturbations coupled to the massive Klein-Gordon equation, we find a characteristic gravitational wave signal, composed by a quasi-normal ringing followed by a late time tail. In contrast to `clean' black holes, however, the late time tail contains small amplitude wiggles with the frequency of the dominating quasi-bound state. Additionally, an observer dependent beating pattern may also be seen. These features were already observed in fully non-linear studies; our analysis shows they are present at linear level, and, since it reduces to a 1+1 dimensional numerical problem, allows for cleaner numerical data.

The wiggly tails, by constrast, are a generic feature that may be used as a smoking gun for the presence of massive fields around black holes, either as a linear cloud or as fully non-linear hair.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2589","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T16:06:27Z","registered":"2022-03-09T16:06:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T16:06:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the field of optics, scattering phase shifts have been utilized to unveil interesting forms of light-matter interactions. Here, we investigate the mode-coupling phase of single photons to surface plasmon polaritons in a quantum plasmonic tritter. We observe that the coupling process induces a phase jump that occurs when photons scatter into surface plasmons and vice versa. This interesting coupling phase dynamics is of particular relevance for quantum plasmonic experiments. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this photon-plasmon interaction can be modeled through a quantum-mechanical tritter. We show that the visibility of a double-slit and a triple-slit interference patterns are convenient observables to characterize the interaction at a slit and determine the coupling phase. Our accurate and simple model of the interaction, validated by simulations and experiments, has important implications not only for quantum plasmonic interference effects, but is also advantageous to classical applications.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10480","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T01:39:27Z","registered":"2022-02-28T01:39:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T01:39:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In this work, we provide a detailed comparison of self-consistent calculations within the ADA with the exact results of the Kohn-Sham density-functional theory, and the elementary Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation. We demonstrate that the ADA for the 2D kinetic energy functional works very well under a wide variety of confinement potentials, even for relatively small particle numbers. Remarkably, the TF approximation for the kinetic energy functional, {\\em without any gradient corrections}, also yields good agreement with the exact kinetic energy for all confining potentials considered, although at the expense of the spatial and kinetic energy densities exhibiting poor point-wise agreement, particularly near the TF radius.

We find that the line core intensity is correlated with the temperature at the formation height but the correlation is rather weak, especially when the lines are strong. The line core Doppler shift is a good measure of the line-of-sight velocity at the formation height. The line width is both dependent on the width of the absorption profile (thermal and non-thermal width) and an opacity broadening factor of 1.2-4 due to the optically thick line formation with a larger broadening for double peak profiles. The 133.5 nm lines can be formed both higher and lower than the core of the Mg II k line depending on the amount of plasma in the 14-50 kK temperature range. More plasma in this temperature range gives a higher 133.5 nm formation height relative to the Mg II k line core. The synthetic line profiles have been compared with IRIS observations. The derived parameters from the simulated line profiles cover the parameter range seen in observations but on average the synthetic profiles are too narrow. We interpret this discrepancy as a combination of a lack of plasma at chromospheric temperatures in the simulation box and too small non-thermal velocities. The large differences in the distribution of properties between the synthetic profiles and the observed ones show that the 133.5 nm lines are powerful diagnostics of the upper chromosphere and lower transition region.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication by the Astrophysical Journal","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04423","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T21:23:57Z","registered":"2022-03-07T21:23:58Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T21:23:58Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Such a sequential storage helps incorporate voluminous modern magnetic data into a stochastic Kalman filter, whereby spatial constraints are incorporated based on a norm derived from statistics of a numerical geodynamo model.

We retrieve core flow features previously documented from the analysis of spherical harmonic field models, such as the eccentric anti-cyclonic gyre. We find enhanced diffusion patterns under both Indonesia and Africa. In contrast to a steady flow that is strong under the Atlantic hemisphere but very weak below the Pacific, interannual motions appear evenly distributed over the two hemispheres. Recovered interannual to decadal flow changes are predominantly symmetrical with respect to the equator outside the tangent cylinder. In contrast, under the Northern Pacific we find an intensification of a high latitude jet, but see no evidence for a corresponding feature in the Southern hemisphere.

In particular, the Euclidean, or imaginary-time, Drude weight can be studied via rigorous renormalization group. As a result, in the past years several universality results have been proven for such quantity at zero temperature; remarkably the proof works for both for integrable and non-integrable quantum spin chains.

To this end, this work presents an in-depth evaluation of simulated interactive WTR search sessions as a more cost-efficient and reproducible alternative to real user studies. As a first of its kind, we introduce interactive query reformulation strategies based on Doc2Query, incorporating cognitive states of simulated user knowledge. Our evaluations include two perspectives on user effectiveness by considering different cost paradigms, namely query-wise and time-oriented measures of effort. Our multi-perspective evaluation scheme reveals new insights about query strategies, the impact of modalities, and different user types in simulated WTR search sessions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"4 pages + references; accepted at CIKM'23","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11931","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2023-10-19T01:20:42Z","registered":"2023-10-19T01:20:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-10-19T01:20:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

How these fields relate to the properties of their progenitor stars is not yet clearly established. However, from the few objects associated with young clusters it has been possible to estimate the initial masses of the progenitors, with results indicating that a very massive progenitor star (M_prog &gt;40Msun) is required to produce a magnetar. Here we present adaptive-optics assisted Keck/NIRC2 imaging and Keck/NIRSPEC spectroscopy of the cluster associated with the magnetar SGR 1900+14, and report that the initial progenitor star mass of the magnetar was a factor of two lower than this limit, M_prog=17 \\pm 2 Msun. Our result presents a strong challenge to the concept that magnetars can only result from very massive progenitors. Instead, we favour a mechanism which is dependent on more than just initial stellar mass for the production of these extreme magnetic fields, such as the \"fossil-field\" model or a process involving close binary evolution.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 8 figs.

This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and the influence of test volume.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Updated with German COVID-19 case data (RKI) from June 28, 2020","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07209","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T03:34:23Z","registered":"2022-02-25T03:34:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T03:34:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This finding underlines the important role of the dislocation of clusters in tracking the external environment of the Milky Way.

NGC 752 is in a slight stage of expansion in the two-dimensional space and will deform itself morphology along the direction perpendicular to the original stretching direction in the future if no other events occur. The relative degree of deformation of the sample clusters in the short-axis direction decreases as their ages increase.

It is also a powerful tool to constrain the radiative decay of active neutrinos. Until now, quantitative analyses have focused on the flux and energy spectrum of such an emission; polarisation has never been considered. Here we show that we could be missing out on an essential piece of information. The radiative decay of neutrinos, as well as the interactions of dark matter and neutrinos with Standard Model particles can generate a circular polarisation signal in X-rays or \u03b3-rays. If observed, this could reveal important information about their spatial distribution and particle-antiparticle ratio, and could even reveal the nature of the high-energy particle physics processes taking place in astrophysical sites. The question of the observability of these polarised signatures and their separation from background astrophysical sources is left for future work.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, published in JCAP","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02754","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T23:42:05Z","registered":"2022-03-04T23:42:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T23:42:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The required quantum resources of smQITE calculations can be further reduced by adopting the circuit form of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) technique, such as the unitary coupled cluster ansatz. We demonstrate that smQITE achieves a similar computational accuracy as VQE at the same fixed-circuit ansatz, without requiring a generally complicated high-dimensional non-convex optimization.

By analyzing the frequency-dependent THz response, a large quantum yield of excitons is found. The scattering time of free charge carriers increases with nanosheet thickness, which is ascribed to reduced effects of surface defects and ligands in thicker nanosheets. The data discussed provide values for the DC mobility in the range 550 - 1000 cm2/Vs for PbS nanosheets with thicknesses ranging from 4 to 16 nm. Results underpin the suitability of colloidal 2D PbS nanosheets for optoelectronic applications.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04711","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T04:06:42Z","registered":"2022-02-27T04:06:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T04:06:45Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The formation of this muonium state is temperature dependent and appears below $\\sim 70$ K. From the temperature dependence we estimate an activation energy of $\\sim 50$ meV in the bulk and $\\sim 23$ meV near the free surface. The field and directional dependence of the muonium precession frequencies further supports the shallow impurity state with a rare example of a fully anisotropic hyperfine tensor. From these measurements we determine the strength of the hyperfine interaction and propose that the muon occupies an interstitial site near the face of the oxygen octahedron in SrTiO$_3$. The observed shallow donor state provides new insight for tailoring the electronic and optical properties of SrTiO$_{3}$-based oxide interface systems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"6 pages, 4 figures.

We start by providing to the reader with a short overview of the current state of art of observations of cosmic magnetic fields. We then illustrate the arguments in favour of a primordial origin of magnetic fields in the galaxies and in the clusters of galaxies. We argue that the most promising way to test this hypothesis is to look for possible imprints of magnetic fields on the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). With this purpose in mind, we provide a review of the most relevant effects of magnetic fields on the CMBR. A long chapter of this review is dedicated to particle physics inspired models which predict the generation of magnetic fields during the early Universe evolution. Although it is still unclear if any of these models can really explain the origin of galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields, we show that interesting effects may arise anyhow. Among these effects, we discuss the consequences of strong magnetic fields on the big-bang nucleosynthesis, on the masses and couplings of the matter constituents, on the electroweak phase transition, and on the baryon and lepton number violating sphaleron processes. Several intriguing common aspects, and possible interplay, of magnetogenesis and baryogenesis are also dicussed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"152 LaTeX pages, 6 figures., final version to appear in Phys.

We find that the system exhibits peculiar competition in energy between different magnetic states in the large-U insulating region. The magnetic competition cannot be explained by the conventional picture based on the geometrical frustration of isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Through an analysis by using a generalized spin model, we find that the effective spin interactions are distinct from the simple Heisenberg form and strongly anisotropic in spin space. We also reveal that they give rise to keen competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. The complex form of the magnetic interactions indicates a crucial role of the orbital degree of freedom. Analyzing a three-orbital Hubbard model, we clarify that the magnetic competition is tightly connected with orbital frustration in the 4d2 electronic configuration through the spin-orbital interplay. The results challenge the conventional picture of the spin-glass behavior that attributes the origin to the geometrical frustration of purely antiferromagnetic exchange interactions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages, 6 figures (accepted for publication as a regular article in PRB)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0660","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-11T18:34:00Z","registered":"2022-03-11T18:34:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-11T18:34:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These couplings influence the iSW-effect in three ways: The Hubble function assumes a different scaling, the structure growth rate shows a different time evolution, and in addition, the Poisson equation, which relates the density perturbations to fluctuations in the gravitational potential, is changed, due to the violation of the scaling rho ~ a^{-3} of the matter density rho with scale factor a. Exemplarily, I derive the iSW-spectra for a model in which dark matter decays into dark energy, investigate the influence of the dark matter decay rate and the dark energy equation of state on the iSW-signal, and discuss the analogies for gravitational lensing. Quite generally iSW-measurements should reach similar accuracy in determining the dark energy equation of state parameter and the coupling constant.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted to MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2239","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T21:52:50Z","registered":"2022-03-16T21:52:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T21:52:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Near the maximal-frustration line, where the system is transformed into a spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain, cotunneling of the particles along the two chains is shown to play a major role in the transport and to drive a quantum phase transition out of the charge-density wave insulator, as the Josephson-coupling energy is increased.

These task-oriented dialogue systems require a semantic parsing module in order to process user utterances and understand the action to be performed. This semantic parsing component was initially implemented by rule-based or statistical slot-filling approaches for processing simple queries; however, the appearance of more complex utterances demanded the application of shift-reduce parsers or sequence-to-sequence models. Although shift-reduce approaches were initially considered the most promising option, the emergence of sequence-to-sequence neural systems has propelled them to the forefront as the highest-performing method for this particular task. In this article, we advance the research on shift-reduce semantic parsing for task-oriented dialogue. We implement novel shift-reduce parsers that rely on Stack-Transformers. This framework allows to adequately model transition systems on the Transformer neural architecture, notably boosting shift-reduce parsing performance. Furthermore, our approach goes beyond the conventional top-down algorithm: we incorporate alternative bottom-up and in-order transition systems derived from constituency parsing into the realm of task-oriented parsing. We extensively test our approach on multiple domains from the Facebook TOP benchmark, improving over existing shift-reduce parsers and state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models in both high-resource and low-resource settings. We also empirically prove that the in-order algorithm substantially outperforms the commonly-used top-down strategy. Through the creation of innovative transition systems and harnessing the capabilities of a robust neural architecture, our study showcases the superiority of shift-reduce parsers over leading sequence-to-sequence methods on the main benchmark.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Final peer-reviewed manuscript accepted for publication in Cognitive Computation","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11984","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-10-24T00:55:59Z","registered":"2022-10-24T00:56:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-09-11T02:09:08Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, they can be hard to build and expensive to simulate for complex living systems. On the other hand, modern data-driven methods thrive at modeling many types of high-dimensional and noisy data. Still, the training and interpretation of these data-driven models remain challenging. Here, we combine the two types of methods to model stochastic neuronal network oscillations. Specifically, we develop a class of first-principles-based artificial neural networks to provide faithful surrogates to the high-dimensional, nonlinear oscillatory dynamics produced by neural circuits in the brain. Furthermore, when the training data set is enlarged within a range of parameter choices, the artificial neural networks become generalizable to these parameters, covering cases in distinctly different dynamical regimes. In all, our work opens a new avenue for modeling complex neuronal network dynamics with artificial neural networks.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"18 pages, 8 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11169","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-11-22T02:30:06Z","registered":"2022-11-22T02:30:07Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-11-26T04:44:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We detect no increase in the planet-to-star radius ratio across the methane feature with a change in radius ratio of $\u0394$R = -0.0007 $\\pm$ 0.0017 corresponding to a scale height (H) change of -0.5 $\\pm$ 1.2 H across the methane feature, assuming a hydrogen dominated atmosphere. We find a variety of water and cloudy atmospheric models fit the data well, but find that cloud-free models provide poor fits. These observations support a flat transmission spectrum resulting from the presence of a high-altitude haze or a water-rich atmosphere, in agreement with previous studies. In this study the observations are predominantly limited by the photometric quality and the limited number of data points (resulting from a long observing cadence), which make the determination of the systematic noise challenging.

Particular attention is paid to the density dependence of the depletion potential. A second-order virial approximation is applied, which yields nearly exact results for the bulk properties of the hard-platelet fluid at densities two times smaller than the density of the isotropic fluid at isotropic-nematic phase coexistence. As the platelet density increases, the attractive primary minimum of the depletion potential deepens and an additional small repulsive barrier at larger sphere separations develops. Upon decreasing the ratio of the radius of the spheres and the platelets, the primary minimum diminishes and the position of the small repulsive barrier shifts to smaller values of the sphere separation.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages, 6 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0401380","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T14:20:45Z","registered":"2022-03-18T14:20:46Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T14:20:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The strength of presence of each possible state in the superposition, i.e., its probability of being observed, is represented by its probability amplitude coefficient. The assumption that these coefficients must be represented physically disjointly from each other, i.e., localistically, is nearly universal in the quantum theory/computing literature. Alternatively, these coefficients can be represented using sparse distributed representations (SDR), wherein each coefficient is represented by small subset of an overall population of units, and the subsets can overlap. Specifically, I consider an SDR model in which the overall population consists of Q WTA clusters, each with K binary units. Each coefficient is represented by a set of Q units, one per cluster. Thus, K^Q coefficients can be represented with KQ units. Thus, the particular world state, X, whose coefficient's representation, R(X), is the set of Q units active at time t has the max probability and the probability of every other state, Y_i, at time t, is measured by R(Y_i)'s intersection with R(X). Thus, R(X) simultaneously represents both the particular state, X, and the probability distribution over all states. Thus, set intersection may be used to classically implement quantum superposition. If algorithms exist for which the time it takes to store (learn) new representations and to find the closest-matching stored representation (probabilistic inference) remains constant as additional representations are stored, this meets the criterion of quantum computing. Such an algorithm has already been described: it achieves this \"quantum speed-up\" without esoteric hardware, and in fact, on a single-processor, classical (Von Neumann) computer.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 2 figs","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05660","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T22:57:10Z","registered":"2022-03-03T22:57:11Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T22:57:11Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Response latency was longer in correct trials compared to error trials. Discrimination accuracy increased with response latency over the range of 500-1200ms. We used morphs between previously learned images to vary the image similarity parametrically, and thereby modulate task difficulty from ceiling to chance.

This is consistent with the newly measured direct CP asymmetry of $B_s \\to \u03c0^+ K^-$. These decays are thus supposed to be important in testing the Standard Model and in probing new physics effects. However, the observation of pure annihilation decay $B_s \\to \u03c0^+ \u03c0^-$ appears to imply a large annihilation scenario with $\u03c1_A \\sim 3$, in contrast to the case of $\u03c1_A \\sim 1$ in $B_{u,d}$ decays in the framework of QCD factorization. This seems to indicate unexpectedly large flavor symmetry breaking effects between the annihilation amplitudes of $B_s$ and $B_{u,d}$ decays. This apparent contradiction could be resolved by noticing that there is a priori no reason to justify the common practice of assuming the universality of annihilation parameters for different Dirac structures of effective operators. We then argue that, for $B_{d,s} \\to \u03c0^\\mp K^\\pm$ decays, the flavor symmetry breaking effects of annihilation amplitudes have all been included in the initial state decay constants and are thus small. But the flavor symmetry breaking effects in $B_{d,s} \\to K^{(\\ast)} K^{(\\ast)}$ decays are likely to be much larger, as part of the annihilation topologies of $B_s \\to K K$ decay could be related to $B_s \\to \u03c0^+ \u03c0^-$ decay. Therefore when new physics effects are searched for in these decay channels, care must be taken to consider the potentially large flavor symmetry breaking effects in more details.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 5 figures, published in Phys.

However, the center of mass may be shifted from the star due to the presence of any non-axisymmetric mass distribution. As a result, the system exerts a gravity force on the star, causing the star to move in response, which can affect the evolution of the circumstellar disk. We aim at studying the effects of stellar motion on the evolution of protostellar and protoplanetary disks. In protostellar disks, a non-axisymmetric distribution of matter in the form of spiral arms or massive clumps can form due to gravitational instability. Protoplanetary disks can also feature non-axisymmetric structures caused by a high-mass planet or a large-scale vortex. We use 2D grid-based hydrodynamic simulations to explore the effect of stellar motion. We adopt a non-inertial polar coordinate system centered on the star, in which the stellar motion is taken into account by calculating the indirect potential caused by the non-axisymmetric disk, a high-mass planet, or a large-scale vortex. We found that the stellar motion has a moderate effect on the evolution history in protostellar disks, reducing somewhat the disk size and mass, while having a profound effect on the collapsing envelope, changing its inner shape from an initially axisymmetric to a non-axisymmetric configuration. Protoplanetary disk simulations show that the stellar motion slightly reduces the width of the gap opened by a high-mass planet, decreases the planet migration rate, and strengthens the large-scale vortices formed at the viscosity transition. We conclude that the inclusion of the indirect potential is recommended in grid-based hydrodynamics simulations of circumstellar disks which use the curvilinear coordinate system.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04751","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T18:36:53Z","registered":"2022-03-04T18:36:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T18:36:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

These extensions are characterized by Yukawa-like matrices, the former by a constant Lorentz 2-tensor $Y^{AB}_{\u03bc\u03bd}$, whereas the latter by a constant Lorentz vector $Y^{AB}_\u03bc$. It is found that the experimental constraints on the decays $l_A\\to l_B\u03b3$ severely restrict lepton flavor violating Higgs signals in the renormalizable scenario. In this context, it is found that $BR(H\\to \u03bc^\\pm e^\\mp)$ and $BR(H\\to \u03c4^\\pm \u03bc^\\mp)$ cannot be larger than $10^{-18}$ and $10^{-11}$, respectively. In the nonrenormalizable scenario, transitions mediated by the Higgs or the $Z$ gauge boson are induced at tree level, and we find mild restrictions on lepton flavor violation. Using the experimental limits on the three-body decays $l_A \\to l_B \\bar{l}_Cl_C$ to constraint the vector $Y^{AB}_\u03bc$, it is found that the branching ratio for the decays $H\\to \u03bc^\\pm e^\\mp$ is of about $4\\times 10^{-9}$, more important, a branching ratio of $7\\times 10^{-4}$ is found for the $\u03c4^\\pm \u03bc^\\mp$ mode. Accordingly, the decay $H \\to \u03c4^\\pm \u03bc^\\mp$ could be at the reach of future measurements. The lepton flavor violating decays of the $Z$ gauge boson were also studied. In the renormalizable scenario, it was found the undetectable branching ratios $BR(Z\\to \u03bc^\\pm e^\\mp)&lt;5.7\\times 10^{-21}$ and $BR(Z\\to \u03c4^\\pm \u03bc^\\mp)&lt;2.0\\times 10^{-12}$. In the nonrenormalizable scenario, it was found that $BR(Z\\to \u03bc^\\pm e^\\mp)&lt;0.67\\times 10^{-12}$ and $BR(Z\\to \u03c4^\\pm \u03bc^\\mp)&lt;1.12\\times 10^{-7}$.

Column densities of P II, Cl I, and Cl II are determined for a combined sample of 107 sight lines probing diffuse atomic and molecular gas in the local Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). We reevaluate the nearly linear relationship between the column densities of Cl I and H$_2$, which arises from the rapid conversion of Cl$^+$ to Cl$^0$ in regions where H$_2$ is abundant. Using the observed total gas-phase P and Cl abundances, we derive depletion parameters for these elements, adopting the methodology of Jenkins. We find that both P and Cl are essentially undepleted along sight lines showing the lowest overall depletions. Increasingly severe depletions of P are seen along molecule-rich sight lines. In contrast, gas-phase Cl abundances show no systematic variation with molecular hydrogen fraction. However, enhanced Cl (and P) depletion rates are found for a subset of sight lines showing elevated levels of Cl ionization. An analysis of neutral chlorine fractions yields estimates for the amount of atomic hydrogen associated with the H$_2$-bearing gas in each direction. These results indicate that the molecular fraction in the H$_2$-bearing gas is at least 10% for all sight lines with $\\log N({\\rm H}_2)\\gtrsim18$ and that the gas is essentially fully molecular at $\\log N({\\rm H}_2)\\approx21$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"44 pages, 21 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09727","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-01-25T01:48:19Z","registered":"2023-01-25T01:48:19Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-05-30T01:50:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Thus, the optimality is proved with inequality among variances of competing estimators. The inequalities, demonstrated here, disfavor the standard least squares estimators. Inequalities among estimators are connected to names of Cramer, Rao and Frechet. The standard demonstrations of these inequalities require very special analytical properties of the probability functions, globally indicated as regular models. These limiting conditions are too restrictive to handle realistic problems in track fitting. A previous extension to heteroscedastic models of the Cramer-Rao-Frechet inequalities was performed with Gaussian distributions. These demonstrations proved beyond any possible doubts the superiority of the heteroscedastic models compared to the standard least squares method. However, the Gaussian distributions are typical members of the required regular models. Instead, the realistic probability distributions, encountered in tracker detectors, are very different from Gaussian distributions. Therefore, to have well grounded set of inequalities, the limitations to regular models must be overtaken. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the inequalities for least squares estimators for irregular models of probabilities, explicitly excluded by the Cramer-Rao-Frechet demonstrations. Estimators for straight and parabolic tracks will be considered. The final part deals with the form of the distributions of simplified heteroscedastic track models reconstructed with optimal estimators and the standard (non-optimal) estimators. A comparison among the distributions of these different estimators shows the large loss in resolution of the standard least-squares estimators.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"It completes the results of INSTRUMENTS 2020 4,2-- 13 pages, 2 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10021","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T21:17:53Z","registered":"2022-02-25T21:17:53Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T21:17:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

More precisely, we introduce, in close analogy to shape dynamics, the generator of a local conformal transformation acting on both, the metric and the scalar field, which coincides with the CMC gauge condition. A new metric, which is invariant under this transformation, is constructed and used to define connection variables which can be quantised by standard loop quantum gravity methods. While it is hard to address dynamical problems in this framework (due to the complicated 'time' function), it seems, due to good accessibility properties of the CMC gauge, to be well suited for problems such as the computation of black hole entropy, where actual physical states can be counted and the dynamics is only of indirect importance. The corresponding calculation yields the surprising result that the usual prescription of fixing the Barbero-Immirzi parameter beta to a constant value in order to obtain the well-known formula S = a(Phi) A/(4G) does not work for the black holes under consideration, while a recently proposed prescription involving an analytic continuation of beta to the case of a self-dual space-time connection yields the correct result. Also, the interpretation of the geometric operators gets an interesting twist, which exemplifies the deep relationship between observables and the choice of a time function and has consequences for loop quantum cosmology.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"8 pages. v2: Journal version.

Classical simulation techniques in quantum chemistry are hampered by the exponential growth of the many-electron Hilbert space as the system size increases. In this work, we propose an algorithm for computing linear and nonlinear molecular response properties on quantum computers, by first reformulating the target property into a symmetric expression more suitable for quantum computation via introducing a set of auxiliary quantum states, and then determining these auxiliary states via solving the corresponding linear systems of equations on quantum computers. On one hand, we prove that using the quantum linear system algorithm [Harrow et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] as a subroutine the proposed algorithm scales only polynomially in the system size instead of the dimension of the exponentially large Hilbert space, and hence achieves an exponential speedup over existing classical algorithms. On the other hand, we introduce a variational hybrid quantum-classical variant of the proposed algorithm, which is more practical for near-term quantum devices.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"7 pages","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03406","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T02:05:22Z","registered":"2022-02-27T02:05:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T02:05:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In the flat space described with the complex octonions, the radius vector is combined with the integrating function of field potential to become a composite radius vector. And the latter can be considered as the radius vector in a flat composite-space (a function space). Further it is able to deduce some formulae between the physical quantity and spatial parameter, in the complex-octonion curved composite-space. Under the condition of weak field approximation, these formulae infer a few results accordant with the General Theory of Relativity. The study reveals that it is capable of ascertaining which physical quantities are able to result in the warping of space, in terms of the curved composite-space described with the complex octonions.

At leading order dChPT predicts a constant mass anomalous dimension $\u03b3_m$, consistent with the assumed proximity of an infrared fixed point. For the relatively large fermion masses simulated by the LatKMI collaboration, the influence of the infrared fixed point diminishes, and our fits suggest that $\u03b3_m$ starts running. Since a complete higher-order analysis is not feasible with presently available data, we adopt a more phenomenological approach. We propose a partial extension to higher orders, which incorporates the running of $\u03b3_m$ into the tree-level lagrangian. We find that this extension successfully describes the full fermion-mass range of the LatKMI data, including the pion taste splittings which arise from using staggered fermions in the lattice simulations. We also investigate a more general class of dilaton potentials proposed in the literature, using both the LSD and LatKMI data sets, concluding that these data favor the form predicted by dChPT.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"RevTeX, 35 pages.

There is a bimodal distribution in half-light radii, with stable star clusters always being smaller than $\\sim30$pc, while stable galaxies are always larger than $\\sim120$pc. We extend the previously known observational relationships and interpret them in terms of a more fundamental pair of intrinsic properties of dark matter itself: dark matter forms cored mass distributions, with a core scale length of greater than about 100pc, and always has a maximum central massdensity with a narrow range. The dark matter in dSph galaxies appears to be clustered such that there is a mean volume mass density within the stellar distribution which has the very low value of about 0.1$\\Msun$ pc$^{-3}$ (about 5GeV/c$^2$ cm$^{-3}$). All dSphs have velocity dispersions equivalent to circular velocities at the edge of their light distributions of $\\sim 15$km s$^{-1}$. In two dSphs there is evidence that the density profile is shallow (cored) in the inner regions, and so far none of the dSphs display kinematics which require the presence of an inner cusp. The maximum central dark matter density derived is model dependent, but is likely to have a mean value (averaged over a volume of radius 10pc) of $\\sim0.1\\Msun$ pc$^{-3}$ (about 5GeV/c$^2$ cm$^{-3}$) for our proposed cored dark mass distributions (where it is similar to the mean value), or $\\sim60\\Msun$ pc$^{-3}$ (about 2TeV/c$^2$ cm$^{-3}$) if the dark matter density distribution is cusped. Galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos with these properties; smaller systems containing dark matter are not observed.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Astrophys J in press, 35pp, 3 tables, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703308","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-16T03:25:09Z","registered":"2022-03-16T03:25:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-16T20:16:34Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

PDGs are designable azimuthally chirped gratings that provide broadband and spatially dispersed plasmonic enhancement. Therefore, they offer the opportunity to observe and compare the overall enhancement from different combinations of enhancement in individual input and output beams. We first confirm PDG's capability of spatially separating the input and output enhancement in linear surface-enhanced fluorescence and Raman scattering. We then investigate spatially resolved enhancement in nonlinear SECARS, where coherent interaction of the pump, Stokes, and anti-Stokes beams is enhanced by the plasmonic gratings. By mapping the SECARS signal and analyzing the azimuthal angle-dependent intensity, we characterize the enhancement at individual frequencies. Together with theoretical analysis, we show that while simultaneous enhancement in the input and output beams is important for SECARS, the enhancement in the pump and anti-Stokes beams plays a more critical role in the overall enhancement than that in the Stokes beam. This work provides an insight into the enhancement mechanism of plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy, which is important for the design and optimization of plasmonic gratings. The PDG platform may also be applied to study enhancement mechanisms in other nonlinear light-matter interactions or the impact of plasmonic gratings on the fluorescence lifetime.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"ACS Nano, published online on 23 December 2020","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04439","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T23:02:32Z","registered":"2022-02-23T23:02:33Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T23:02:33Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We used the HaloSat all-sky survey to study the CGM's soft X-ray emission in order to better define its distribution and structure. We extend a previous HaloSat study of the southern CGM (Galactic latitude b &lt; -30 deg) to include the northern CGM (b &gt; 30 deg) and find evidence that at least two hot gas model components at different temperatures are required to produce the observed emission. The cooler component has a typical temperature of kT ~ 0.18 keV, while the hotter component has a typical temperature of kT ~ 0.7 keV. The emission measure in both the warm and hot components has a wide range (~ 0.005 - 0.03, ~ 0.0005 - 0.004 cm-6 pc respectively), indicating that the CGM is clumpy. A patch of relatively consistent CGM was found in the north, allowing for the CGM spectrum to be studied in finer detail using a stacked spectrum. The stacked spectrum is well described with a model including two hot gas components at temperatures of kT = 0.166 +/- 0.005 keV and kT = 0.69 +0.04 -0.05 keV. As an alternative to adding a hot component, a neon-enhanced single-temperature model of the CGM was also tested and found to have worse fit statistics and poor residuals.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"23 pages, 14 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02477","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-08-05T00:51:48Z","registered":"2022-08-05T00:51:48Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-09-08T01:20:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Since our universe tends to be permeated by a large number of isolated structures, as temperature diminishes with the expansion, we model our universe with a 3d domain wall with increasing internal structures. These structures could be unstable 2d domain walls evolving to fermi-balls which are candidates to cold dark matter. The momentum transfer of bulk particles colliding with the 3d domain wall is related to the reflection coefficient. We show a nontrivial dependence of the reflection coefficient with the number of internal dark matter structures inside the 3d domain wall. As the population of such structures increases the velocity of the domain wall expansion also increases. The expansion is exponential at early times and polynomial at late times. We connect this picture with string/M-theory by considering BPS 3d domain walls with structures which can appear through the bosonic sector of a five-dimensional supergravity theory.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"To appear in Phys.

However, these models often struggle when fine-tuned on small datasets. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various adaptation approaches. Prompt-based tuning is arguably the most common way, especially for larger models. Previous research shows that adding contrastive learning to prompt-based fine-tuning is effective as it helps the model generate embeddings that are more distinguishable between classes, and it can also be more sample-efficient as the model learns from positive and negative examples simultaneously. One of the most important components of contrastive learning is data augmentation, but unlike computer vision, effective data augmentation for NLP is still challenging. This paper proposes LM-CPPF, Contrastive Paraphrasing-guided Prompt-based Fine-tuning of Language Models, which leverages prompt-based few-shot paraphrasing using generative language models, especially large language models such as GPT-3 and OPT-175B, for data augmentation. Our experiments on multiple text classification benchmarks show that this augmentation method outperforms other methods, such as easy data augmentation, back translation, and multiple templates.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables, 1 algorithm Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18169","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2023-05-30T01:38:08Z","registered":"2023-05-30T01:38:09Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-08-25T01:27:17Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Given a complete graph G = (V, E) and non-negative distances d for every edge, the TSP asks for a shortest tour through all vertices with respect to the distances d. The method of choice for solving the TSP to optimality is a branch and cut approach. Usually the integrality constraints are relaxed first and all separation processes to identify violated inequalities are done on fractional solutions. In our approach we try to exploit the impressive performance of current ILP-solvers and work only with integer solutions without ever interfering with fractional solutions. We stick to a very simple ILP-model and relax the subtour elimination constraints only. The resulting problem is solved to integer optimality, violated constraints (which are trivial to find) are added and the process is repeated until a feasible solution is found. In order to speed up the algorithm we pursue several attempts to find as many relevant subtours as possible. These attempts are based on the clustering of vertices with additional insights gained from empirical observations and random graph theory. Computational results are performed on test instances taken from the TSPLIB95 and on random Euclidean graphs.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03533","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T08:54:09Z","registered":"2022-03-07T08:54:10Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T08:54:10Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The spectrum reveals strong absorption in MgII and FeII resonance transitions with Doppler shifts of -200 to -300 km/s, indicating a cool gas outflow. Emission in MgII near and redward of systemic velocity, in concert with the observed absorption, yields a P Cygni-like line profile similar to those observed in the Ly alpha transition in Lyman Break Galaxies. Further, the MgII emission is spatially resolved, and extends significantly beyond the emission from stars and HII regions within the galaxy. Assuming the emission has a simple, symmetric surface brightness profile, we find that the gas extends to distances &gt; ~7 kpc. We also detect several narrow FeII* fine-structure lines in emission near the systemic velocity, arising from energy levels which are radiatively excited directly from the ground state. We suggest that the MgII and FeII* emission is generated by photon scattering in the observed outflow, and emphasize that this emission is a generic prediction of outflows. These observations provide the first direct constraints on the minimum spatial extent and morphology of the wind from a distant galaxy. Estimates of these parameters are crucial for understanding the impact of outflows in driving galaxy evolution.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to ApJL. 6 pages, 4 figures.

Same must hold true to any observables that are determined by the connected correlation functions through a linear relation. This behavior resembles strongly that of a free theory where disorder is coupled to the fundamental field. We demonstrate this by both the means of holographic principle and field theory analysis in a toy model.

Clouds are selected at redshifts $0\\leq z\\leq 3$ with the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) technique. The main properties of so selected clouds are analyzed in 3D space and with the core sampling approach, what allows us to compare estimates of the DM LSS evolution obtained with two different techniques and to clarify some important aspects of the LSS evolution. In both cases we find that regular redshift variations of the mean characteristics of the DM LSS are accompanied only by small variations of their PDFs, what indicates the self similar character of the DM LSS evolution. The high degree of relaxation of DM particles compressed within the LSS is found along the shortest principal axis of clouds. We see that the internal structure of selected clouds depends upon the mass resolution and scale of perturbations achieved in simulations. It is found that the low mass tail of the PDFs of the LSS characteristics depends upon the procedure of clouds selection.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2951","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T00:51:27Z","registered":"2022-03-14T00:51:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T00:51:28Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Recently, researchers found that the range of the velocity correlations increases with increasing persistence time of the self-propulsion and can extend over many particle diameters. Here we review the initial studies of long-ranged velocity correlations in solid-like systems of self-propelled particles. Then, we demonstrate that the long-ranged velocity correlations are also present in dense fluid-like systems.

Depending on the concentration, the presence of these defects in LaAlO3 slab can suppress the surface conductivity. In contrast, in insulating SrTiO3 slabs already very small concentrations of oxygen vacancies or hydrogen dopant atoms induce a finite occupation of the conduction band. Surface defects in insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure slabs with three LaAlO3 overlayers lead to the emergence of interface conductivity. Calculated defect formation energies reveal strong preference of hydrogen dopant atoms for surface sites for all structures and concentrations considered. Strong decrease of the defect formation energy of hydrogen adatoms with increasing thickness of the LaAlO3 overlayer and crossover from positive to negative values, taken together with the metallic conductivity induced by hydrogen adatoms, seamlessly explains the semiconductor-metal transition observed for these heterostructures as a function of the overlayer thickness. Moreover, we show that the potential drop and concomitant shift of (layer resolved) band edges is suppressed for the metallic configuration. Finally, magnetism with stable local moments, which form atomically thin magnetic layers at the interface, is generated by oxygen vacancies either at the surface or the interface, or by hydrogen atoms buried at the interface. In particular, oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 interface layer cause drastic downshift of the 3d e_g states of the Ti atoms neighboring the vacancies, giving rise to strongly localized magnetic moments, which add to the two-dimensional background magnetization.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 17 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01382","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T03:49:23Z","registered":"2022-03-03T03:49:24Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T03:49:24Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Wegner, Ann. Phys. 506, 77 (1994), S. D. G\u0142azek and K. G. Wilson, Phys. Rev. D 49, 4214 (1994)] to the formulation of useful many-body theories of electron correlation are considered. In addition to presenting a production-level implementation of the SRG based on a single-reference formalism, a novel integral version of the SRG is reported, in which the flow of the Hamiltonian is driven by a source operator. It is shown that this driven SRG (DSRG) produces a Hamiltonian flow that is analogous to that of the SRG. Compared to the SRG, which requires propagating a set of ordinary differential equations, the DSRG is computationally advantageous since it consists of a set of polynomial equations. The equilibrium distances, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and vibrational anharmonicities of a series of diatomic molecules computed with the SRG and DSRG approximated with one- and two-body normal ordered operators are in good agreement with benchmark values from coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)]. Particularly surprising results are found when the SRG and DSRG methods are applied to C$_2$ and F$_2$. In the former case both methods fail to converge, while in the latter case an unbound potential energy curve is obtained. A modified commutator approximation is shown to correct these problems in the case of the DSRG method.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0114","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T17:10:30Z","registered":"2022-03-09T17:10:31Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T17:10:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

A series of polar cap patches were observed by the ESR between 8:40 and 10:20 UT on December 3, 2011. The polar cap patches combined with the auroral dynamics were associated with a significantly higher GPS phase scintillation level (up to 0.6 rad) than those observed for the other two alternatives, i.e., cusp dynamics without polar cap patches, and polar cap patches without cusp aurora. The cusp auroral dynamics without plasma patches were indeed related to GPS phase scintillations at a moderate level (up to 0.3 rad). The polar cap patches away from the active cusp were associated with sporadic and moderate GPS phase scintillations (up to 0.2 rad). The main conclusion is that the worst global navigation satellite system space weather events on the dayside occur when polar cap patches enter the polar cap and are subject to particle precipitation and flow shears, which is analogous to the nightside when polar cap patches exit the polar cap and enter the auroral oval.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06687","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T19:06:00Z","registered":"2022-03-03T19:06:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T19:06:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Its protonated form, HOCO+, is believed to be a good proxy for gaseous CO2. However, it has been detected in only a few star-forming regions so far, so that its interstellar chemistry is not well understood. We present new detections of HOCO+ lines in 11 high-mass star-forming clumps. Our observations increase by more than three times the number of detections in star-forming regions so far. We have derived beam-averaged abundances relative to H2 in between 0.3 and 3.8 x 10^{-11}. We have compared these values with the abundances of H13CO+, a possible gas-phase precursor of HOCO+, and CH3OH, a product of surface chemistry. We have found a positive correlation with H13CO+, while with CH3OH there is no correlation. We suggest that the gas-phase formation route starting from HCO+ plays an important role in the formation of HOCO+, perhaps more relevant than protonation of CO2 (upon evaporation of this latter from icy dust mantles).","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10179","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T00:47:15Z","registered":"2022-03-02T00:47:16Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T00:47:16Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Strehl ratios of 15-30% were achieved in the Ks-band, yielding near-infrared images of this dense and complex region at unprecedented angular resolution at these wavelengths. The MAD data are used to construct a near-infrared luminosity profile for R136, the cluster at the core of 30 Dor. Using cluster profiles of the form used by Elson et al., we find the surface brightness can be fit by a relatively shallow power-law function (gamma~1.5-1.7) over the full extent of the MAD data, which extends to a radius of ~40\" (~10pc). We do not see compelling evidence for a break in the luminosity profile as seen in optical data in the literature, arguing that cluster asymmetries are the dominant source, although extinction effects and stars from nearby triggered star-formation likely also contribute. These results highlight the need to consider cluster asymmetries and multiple spatial components in interpretation of the luminosity profiles of distant unresolved clusters. We also investigate seven candidate young stellar objects reported by Gruendl &amp; Chu from Spitzer observations, six of which have apparent counterparts in the MAD images. The most interesting of these (GC09: 053839.24-690552.3) appears related to a striking bow-shock--like feature, orientated away from both R136 and the Wolf-Rayet star Brey 75, at distances of 19.5\" and 8\" (4.7 and 1.9pc in projection), respectively.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"16 pages, 21 figures (1 degraded for submission), accepted by MNRAS.

Archival snapshot WFPC2 imaging from the survey by Malkan et al. showed a dust feature stretching between the galaxies, apparently being captured by NGC 1409. The new images allow estimates of the mass being transferred and rate of transfer. An absorption lane typically 0.25\" (100 pc) wide with a representative optical depth tau_B = 0.2 cuts across the spiral structure of NGC 1410, crosses the 7-kpc projected space between the nuclei, wraps in front of and, at the limits of detection, behind NGC 1409, and becomes a denser (tau_B = 0.4) polar feature around the core of NGC 1409. Combination of extinction data in two passbands allows a crude three-dimensional recovery of the dust structure, supporting the front/back geometry derived from colors and extinction estimates. The whole feature contains of order $10^6$ solar masses in dust, implying about 2x10^7 solar masses of gas, requiring a mass transfer rate averaging ~1 solar mass per year unless we are particularly unlucky in viewing angle. Curiously, this demonstrable case of mass transfer seems to be independent of the occurrence of a Seyfert nucleus, since the Seyfert galaxy in this pair is the donor of the material. Likewise, the recipient shows no signs of recent star formation from incoming gas, although NGC 1410 has numerous luminous young star clusters and widespread H-alpha emission.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"27 pages, 9 figures.

The 0.5$-$25 keV persistent spectrum comprised of an absorbed high energy cutoff power law with photon index of $\u0393\\sim$ 0.8 and cutoff at $\\sim$16 keV, a soft thermal component with kT$_{BB} \\sim$ 0.14 keV and Gaussian components corresponding to Fe K$_\u03b1$, Ne \\textsc{ix} and Ne \\textsc{x} emission lines. Assuming a source distance of 50 kpc, we determined 0.5--25 keV luminosity to be $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01003","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-12-05T01:18:16Z","registered":"2022-12-05T01:18:17Z","published":null,"updated":"2023-02-23T18:59:18Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Existing tests for network enrichment analysis deal only with undirected networks, they can be computationally slow and are based on normality assumptions. We propose NEAT, a test for network enrichment analysis. The test is based on the hypergeometric distribution, which naturally arises as the null distribution in this context. NEAT can be applied not only to undirected, but to directed and partially directed networks as well. Our simulations indicate that NEAT is considerably faster than alternative resampling-based methods, and that its capacity to detect enrichments is at least as good as the one of alternative tests. We discuss applications of NEAT to network analyses in yeast by testing for enrichment of the Environmental Stress Response target gene set with GO Slim and KEGG functional gene sets, and also by testing for associations between GO Slim categories themselves. NEAT is a flexible and efficient test for network enrichment analysis that aims to overcome some limitations of existing resampling-based tests.

Our data also enables us to identify substructure in the flares. From changing starspot modulation in the NGTS data we detect a stellar rotation period of 59 hours, along with evidence for differential rotation. We combine this rotation period with the observed \\textit{ROSAT} X-ray flux to determine that the star's X-ray activity is saturated. We calculate the flare bolometric energies as $5.4^{+0.8}_{-0.7}\\times10^{34}$ and $2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\\times10^{34}$ erg and compare our detections with G star superflares detected in the \\textit{Kepler} survey. We find our main flare to be one of the largest amplitude superflares detected from a bright G star. With energies more than 100 times greater than the Carrington event, our flare detections demonstrate the role that ground-based instruments such as NGTS can have in assessing the habitability of Earth-like exoplanets, particularly in the era of \\textit{PLATO}.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"11 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for Publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03377","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T17:36:36Z","registered":"2022-03-02T17:36:36Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T17:36:36Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

There is an abundance of H$_2$O absorption lines from the $\u03bd_1$ and $\u03bd_3$ vibrational bands at 2.7 $\u03bc$m, from the $\u03bd_2$ vibrational band at 6.1 $\u03bc$m, and from pure rotational transitions near 10-13 $\u03bc$m. Analysis of state-specific column densities derived from the resolved absorption features reveals that an isothermal absorbing slab model is incapable of explaining the relative depths of different absorption features. In particular, the strongest absorption features are much weaker than expected, indicating optical depth effects resulting from the absorbing gas being well-mixed with the warm dust that serves as the \"background\" continuum source at all observed wavelengths. The velocity at which the strongest H$_2$O absorption occurs coincides with the velocity centroid along the minor axis of the compact disk in Keplerian rotation recently observed in H$_2$O emission with ALMA. We postulate that the warm regions of this dust disk dominate the continuum emission at near-to-mid infrared wavelengths, and that H$_2$O and several other molecules observed in absorption are probing this disk. Absorption line profiles are not symmetric, possibly indicating that the warm dust in the disk that produces the infrared continuum has a non-uniform distribution similar to the substructure observed in 1.3 mm continuum emission.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, ApJ accepted","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05818","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T07:39:21Z","registered":"2022-02-25T07:39:22Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T07:39:22Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Many existing methods, however, discover either models that are difficult to read, or return so many results interpretation becomes impossible. Here, we study a fully automated approach for mining easily interpretable models for binary data. We model data hierarchically with noisy tiles-rectangles with significantly different density than their parent tile. To identify good trees, we employ the Minimum Description Length principle. We propose STIJL, a greedy any-time algorithm for mining good tile trees from binary data. Iteratively, it finds the locally optimal addition to the current tree, allowing overlap with tiles of the same parent. A major result of this paper is that we find the optimal tile in only $\u0398(NM\\min(N, M))$ time.

It is shown that the leakage current in thin (20-40 nm) films is normally smaller than 10^-8 A/cm2, the breakdown field being greater than 108 V/cm. In hybrid structures with printed FG layers in which graphene was transferred onto, or capsulated with, an FG layer, an increase in charge-carrier mobility and material conductivity amounting to 5-6 times was observed. The spectrum of future applications of FG layers can be further extended due to the possibility of obtaining, from weakly fluorinated graphene (&lt; 20%), functional layers exhibiting a negative differential resistance behavior and, at fluorination degrees of 20-23%, field-effect-transistor channels with current modulation reaching several orders. Composite or bilayer films based on fluorographene and V2O5 or polyvinyl alcohol exhibit a stable resistive switching behavior.

The former defines the intrinsic spectrum of a galaxy, which is modified by the latter. These two effects are degenerate. Using the IllustrisTNG100 simulation, we study the impact of the IGM on Ly$\u03b1$ spectral shapes between $z\\sim 0$ and $5$. We compute the distribution of the expected Ly$\u03b1$ peaks and of the peak asymmetry for different intrinsic spectra, redshifts and large-scale environments. We find that the commonly used averaged transmission curves give an incorrect perception of the observed spectral properties. We show that the distributions of peak counts and asymmetry can lift the degeneracy between the intrinsic spectrum and the IGM absorption. For example, we expect a significant number of triple peaked Ly$\u03b1$ spectra (up to 30% at $z\\sim 3$) if the galaxies' HI distribution become more porous at higher redshift as predicted by cosmological simulations. We provide a public catalog of transmission curves to be used in future simulations and observations to allow a more realistic IGM treatment.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"A reduced data set underlying this publication is available at https://zenodo.org/record/3832098","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10041","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-24T21:50:51Z","registered":"2022-02-24T21:50:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-24T21:50:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We analyze the elastic scattering of electron neutrinos (Dirac or Majorana, respectively) on the unpolarized electrons in the relativistic neutrino limit. We assume that the incoming neutrino beam is the superposition of left-right chiral states. Left chiral neutrinos may be detected by the standard $V A$ and non-standard scalar $S_L$, tensor $T_L$ interactions, while right chiral ones partake only in the exotic $V + A$ and $S_R, T_R$ interactions. Our model-independent study is carried out for the flavour (current) neutrino eigenstates. We compute the expected event number for the standard $V-A$ interaction of the left chiral neutrinos using the current experimental values of standard couplings and in the case of left-right chiral superposition. We show that the significant decrement in the event number due to the interference terms between the standard and exotic interactions for the Majorana $\u03bd_e$'s may appear. The $90 \\%$ C.

While correlations between the microions are neglected in this approach, many-body interactions between the colloids are fully included. The solid-liquid transition is determined at a high colloid volume fraction where many-body interactions are expected to be strong. With a view to the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory predicting that colloids interact via Yukawa pair-potentials, we compare our results with the phase diagram of a simple Yukawa liquid. Good agreement is found at high salt conditions, while at low ionic strength considerable deviations are observed. By calculating effective colloid-colloid pair-interactions it is demonstrated that these differences are due to many-body interactions. We suggest a density-dependent pair-potential in the form of a truncated Yukawa potential, and show that it offers a considerably improved description of the solid-liquid phase-behavior of concentrated colloidal suspensions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0209162","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T01:43:53Z","registered":"2022-03-19T01:43:54Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T01:43:54Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The final state of the black hole radiation is conveniently summarized by a tensor network built from these isometries. We introduce a set of quantities generalizing the Renyi entropies that provide a complete set of bipartite/multipartite entanglement measures, and give a general formula for the average of these over initial black hole states in terms of the isometries defining the model. For models where the dimension of the final tensor product radiation Hilbert space is the same as that of the space of initial black hole microstates, the entanglement structure is universal, independent of the choice of isometries. In the more general case, we find that models which best capture the \"information-free\" property of black hole horizons are those whose isometries are tensors corresponding to states of tripartite systems with maximally mixed subsystems.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"22 pages, 4 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08613","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T02:45:41Z","registered":"2022-03-06T02:45:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T02:45:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The proposed LODF metrics are used to select the high-impact branches. Based on each selected branch, the approach constructs the subgraph with parameters of distance and search level, while using branches' LODF metrics as the weights. A key innovation of this work is the use of the distance and search level parameters, which allow the subgraph to identify the most coupled critical elements that may be far away from a selected branch. The proposed approach is validated using the 200- and 500-bus test cases, and results show that the proposed approach can identify multiple N-x contingencies that cause violations.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Published in the 12th Conference on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies, North America (ISGT NA)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08415","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-23T15:32:42Z","registered":"2022-02-23T15:32:43Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-23T15:32:43Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We discuss constraints complementary to those of Maoz (1998) and demonstrate that an extremely wide range of other possibilities can be excluded. In particular, we present the new argument that for the velocity dispersions inferred for many galactic nuclei, even binaries made of point masses cannot stave off core collapse because hard binaries are so tight that they merge via emission of gravitational radiation before they can engage in three-body or four-body interactions. We also show that under these conditions core collapse leads inevitably to runaway growth of a central black hole with a significant fraction of the initial mass, regardless of the masses of the individual stars. For clusters of noninteracting low-mass objects (from low-mass stars to elementary particles), relaxation of stars and compact objects that pass inside the dark region will be accelerated by interactions with the dark mass. If the dark region is instead a self-supported object such as a fermion ball, then if stellar-mass black holes exist they will collide with the object, settle, and consume it. The net result is that the keyhole through which alternatives to supermassive black holes must pass is substantially smaller and more contrived than it was even a few years ago.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"5 pages including 1 figure, accepted by MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512194","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T22:24:19Z","registered":"2022-03-17T22:24:20Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T22:24:20Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The steady-state equilibrium flow contains a shock of the type derived by Roberts in the tightly wound approximation. We find that boundary conditions are critical in determining whether the solutions are stable or not. Shocks are unstable if periodic boundary conditions are imposed. For intermediate strengths of the spiral potential, the instability disappears if boundary conditions are imposed such that the upstream flow is left unperturbed as in the classic analysis of D'yakov and Kontorovich. This reconciles apparently contradictory findings of previous authors regarding the stability of spiral shocks. This also shows that the instability is distinct from the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, confirming the findings of Kim et al. We suggest that instability is a general characteristics of periodic shocks, regardless of the presence of shear, and provide a physical picture as to why this is the case. For strong spiral potentials, high post-shock shear makes the system unstable also to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability regardless of the boundary conditions. Our analysis is performed in the context of a simplified problem that, while preserving all the important characteristics of the original problem, strips it from unnecessary complications, and assumes that the gas is isothermal, non self-gravitating, non-magnetised.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in MNRAS","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00301","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T18:56:29Z","registered":"2022-03-03T18:56:30Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T18:56:30Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In general these Vekua equations are bicomplex. However we show that the whole theory of pseudoanalytic functions without modifications can be applied to these equations under a certain not restrictive condition. As an example we formulate the similarity principle which is the central reason why a pseudoanalytic function and as a consequence a spinor field depending on two space variables share many of the properties of analytic functions. One of the surprising consequences of the established relation with pseudoanalytic functions consists in the following result. Consider the Dirac equation with a scalar potential depending on one variable with fixed energy and mass. In general this equation cannot be solved explicitly even if one looks for wave functions of one variable. Nevertheless for such Dirac equation we obtain an algorithmically simple procedure for constructing in explicit form a complete system of exact solutions (depending on two variables). These solutions generalize the system of powers of z in complex analysis and are called formal powers. With their aid any regular solution of the Dirac equation can be represented by its Taylor series in formal powers.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0506072","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-21T20:54:22Z","registered":"2022-03-21T20:54:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-21T20:54:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The experiments were however limited to recurrent sequence-to-sequence architectures and relatively small data settings. We focus on the state-of-the-art Transformer model and use comparably larger corpora. Specifically, we try to promote the knowledge of source-side syntax using multi-task learning either through simple data manipulation techniques or through a dedicated model component. In particular, we train one of Transformer attention heads to produce source-side dependency tree. Overall, our results cast some doubt on the utility of multi-task setups with linguistic information. The data manipulation techniques, recommended in previous works, prove ineffective in large data settings. The treatment of self-attention as dependencies seems much more promising: it helps in translation and reveals that Transformer model can very easily grasp the syntactic structure. An important but curious result is, however, that identical gains are obtained by using trivial \"linear trees\" instead of true dependencies. The reason for the gain thus may not be coming from the added linguistic knowledge but from some simpler regularizing effect we induced on self-attention matrices.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"CICLING 2019","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11218","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-27T03:52:02Z","registered":"2022-02-27T03:52:03Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-27T03:52:03Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This requires a mechanism for the baryogenesis after the entropy production, and the Affleck and Dine (AD) mechanism is a promising candidate for it. The AD baryogenesis in the GMSB model predicts the existence of the baryonic Q ball, that is the B ball, and this may work as the dark matter in the Universe. In this article, we discuss the stability of the B ball in th presence of baryon-number violating interactions. We find that the evaporation rate increases monotonically with the B-ball charge because the large field value inside the B ball enhances the effect of the baryon-number-violating operators. While there are some difficulties to evaluate the evaporation rate of the B ball, we derive the evaporation time (lifetime) of the B ball for the mass-to-charge ratio $\u03c9_0\\gsim 100 \\MEV$.

It shows a broad-band spectrum extending from radio to X-rays whose luminosity cannot be explained by thermal emission from the system components alone, and is instead explained through synchrotron emission powered by the spin-down of the white dwarf. We analysed NTT/ULTRACAM, TNT/ULTRASPEC, and GTC/HiPERCAM high-speed photometric data for AR Sco spanning almost seven years and obtained a precise estimate of the spin frequency derivative, now confirmed with 50-sigma significance. Using archival photometry, we show that the spin down rate of P/Pdot = 5.6e6 years has remained constant since 2005. As well as employing the method of pulse-arrival time fitting used for previous estimates, we also found a consistent value via traditional Fourier analysis for the first time. In addition, we obtained optical time-resolved spectra with WHT/ISIS and VLT/X-shooter. We performed modulated Doppler tomography for the first time for the system, finding evidence of emission modulated on the orbital period. We have also estimated the projected rotational velocity of the M-dwarf as a function of orbital period and found that it must be close to Roche lobe filling. Our findings provide further constraints for modelling this unique system.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 18 figures.

The oscillation was detected on all 8 occasions on which the source was observed over a timespan of nearly a year, making it the first such persistent periodic pulse found in a symbiotic binary. The amplitude was typically 2 - 5 mmag, and it was correlated with the optical brightness during a relatively small outburst of the system. The most natural explanation is that the oscillation arises from the rotation of an accreting, magnetic (B_S &gt; 10^5 G) white dwarf. This discovery constrains the outburst mechanisms, since the oscillation emission region near the surface of the white dwarf was visible during the outburst.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal (6 pages, including 4 figures), LaTeX","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9812294","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-20T15:04:48Z","registered":"2022-03-20T15:04:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-20T15:04:49Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Key idea is to use spin-double refraction of an electronic beam with a nonzero incidence angle. A region where the spin-orbit coupling is present separates the source and the drain without spin-orbit coupling. We show how the transmission and the beam spin-polarization critically depend on the incidence angle. The transmission halves when the incidence angle is greater than a limit angle and a significant spin-polarization appears. Increasing the spin-orbit coupling one can obtain the modulation of the intensity and of the spin-polarization of the output electronic current when the input current is unpolarized.

For the large scale behavior a supersymmetric theory with collective fields is constructed and studied within saddle point approximation and fluctuations. The model is characterized by a broken supersymmetry indicating that only the fermion collective field becomes delocalized whereas the boson field is exponentially localized. Power counting for the fluctuation terms suggests that the interactions between delocalized fluctuations are irrelevant. Several quasi--scaling regimes, separated by large cross--over lengths, are found with effective exponents $\u03bd$ for the localization length $\u03be_l$. In the asymptotic regime there is $\u03bd=1/2$ in agreement with an earlier calculation of Affleck and one by Ludwig et al. for finite density of states. The effective exponent, relevant for physical system, is $\u03bd=1$ where the coefficient of $\u03be_l$ is growing with randomness. This is in agreement with recent high precision measurements on Si MOSFET and AlGaAs/GaAs samples.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages, RevTeX, 2 figures, to appear in Phys.Rev.

Using recent techniques for 1D quantum systems at large-$N$, we formulate a hydrodynamical effective theory for the eigenvalues. The result is a simple 2D free boson BCFT on a curved background, describing the quantum fluctuations of the eigenvalues around $\u03c1_0(E)$, which is now the large-$N$ limit of the quantum expectation value of the eigenvalue density operator $\\hat\u03c1(E)$. The average over the ensemble of random matrices becomes a quantum expectation value. Equal-time density correlations reproduce the results (including non-perturbative corrections) of random matrix theory. This suggests an interpretation of JT gravity as dual to a $\\textit{one-time-point}$ reduction of MQM. As an application, we compute the R\u00e9nyi entropy associated to a bipartition of the eigenvalues. We match a previous result by Hartnoll and Mazenc for the $c=1$ matrix model dual to two-dimensional string theory and extend it to arbitrary $\u03c1_0(E)$. The hydrodynamical theory provides a clear picture of the emergence of spacetime in two dimensional string theory. The entropy is naturally finite and displays a large amount of short range entanglement, proportional to the microcanonical entropy.

In the phase-separated steady state of the model defined on a finite ring, the properties of the density profile are studied and the exponent governing the decay of the current with the system size in the biased phase is derived. In case all consecutive particles are coupled with each other and form a closed string, the current is found to be enhanced compared to the model without coupling, while if groups of consecutive particles form finite strings, the current is reduced. The motion of a semi-infinite string entering an initially empty lattice is also studied. Here, the diffusion of the head of the string is found to be anomalous, and two phases can be distinguished, which are characterised by different functional dependences of the diffusion exponent on the bias.

We examine the OA effect using unique matched-pair data for the journal Nature Materials. Our study finds that OA links perform better than paid content links. In particular, when the journal does not indicate that a link to an article is an OA link, there is an obvious drop in performance against clicks on links indicating OA status. OA has a positive effect on the number of clicks in all countries, but its positive impact is slightly greater in developed countries. The results suggest that free content is more attractive to users than paid content. Social media exposure of scholarly articles promotes the use of research outputs.

We first briefly review our old constraints on the full electroweakino sector of these models, containing both lighter and heavier sparticles, using the ATLAS trilepton data from the LHC Run I. Next we derive new stronger constraints on this sector for the first time using the ATLAS Run II data. We identify some benchmark points and explore the prospect of observing multilepton events in future LHC experiments. Our focus is on the channels with $n &gt; 3$ which are the hallmarks of the heavier electroweakinos. If the spectrum of the lighter electroweakinos is compressed, these signals might very well be the discovery channels of the electroweakinos at the high luminosity LHC. We also discuss the implications of the new LHC constraints for the observed dark matter relic density of the universe, the measured value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the dark matter direct detection experiments.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05129","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-02T14:54:38Z","registered":"2022-03-02T14:54:40Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-02T14:54:40Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Here we explore the collisional formation of exomoons through giant planetary impacts. We make use of smooth particle hydrodynamical (SPH) collision simulations and survey a large phase-space of terrestrial/super-terrestrial planetary collisions. We characterize the properties of such collisions, finding one rare case in which an exomoon forms through a graze&amp;capture scenario, in addition to a few graze&amp;merge or hit&amp;run scenarios. Typically however, our collisions form massive circumplanetary discs, for which we use follow-up N-body simulations in order to derive lower-limit mass estimates for the ensuing exomoons. We investigate the mass, long-term tidal-stability, composition and origin of material in both the discs and the exomoons. Our giant-impact models often generate relatively iron-rich moons, that form beyond the synchronous radius of the planet, and would thus tidally evolve outward with stable orbits, rather than be destroyed. Our results suggest that it is extremely difficult to collisionally form currently-detectable exomoons orbiting super-terrestrial planets, through single giant impacts. It might be possible to form massive, detectable exomoons through several mergers of smaller exomoons, formed by multiple impacts, however more studies are required in order to reach a conclusion. Given the current observational initiatives, the search should focus primarily on more massive planet categories. However, about a quarter of the exomoons predicted by our models are approximately Mercury-mass or more, and are much more likely to be detectable given a factor 2 improvement in the detection capability of future instruments, providing further motivation for their development.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12854","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-28T11:52:12Z","registered":"2022-02-28T11:52:14Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-28T11:52:14Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Inspired by the efficient decision-making dynamics of fish schools, CSI divides a human population into a set of small subgroups connected by AI agents. This enables the full group to hold a unified conversation. In this study, groups of 25 participants were tasked with selecting a roster of players in a real Fantasy Baseball contest. A total of 10 trials were run using CSI. In half the trials, each subgroup was augmented with a fact-providing AI agent referred to herein as an Infobot. The Infobot was loaded with a wide range of MLB statistics. The human participants could query the Infobot the same way they would query other persons in their subgroup. Results show that when using CSI, the 25-person groups outperformed 72% of individually surveyed participants and showed significant intelligence amplification versus the mean score (p=0.016). The CSI-enabled groups also significantly outperformed the most popular picks across the collected surveys for each daily contest (p&lt;0.001). The CSI sessions that used Infobots scored slightly higher than those that did not, but it was not statistically significant in this study. That said, 85% of participants agreed with the statement 'Our decisions were stronger because of information provided by the Infobot' and only 4% disagreed. In addition, deliberations that used Infobots showed significantly less variance (p=0.039) in conversational content across members.

Six-dimensional Weyl fermions propagating on this background give rise to a chiral zero-mode, which makes them interesting for phenomenological applications. The compact two-dimensional space is flat and has three conical singularities. We consider the one-loop structure of these theories, and show that the presence of logarithmic divergences requires the introduction of counterterms precisely at these three singular points. We also show that the corresponding localized operators are rotationally symmetric in the plane of the two extra dimensions, as expected from the geometry about the singularities. We derive the propagators for spin-0, spin-1/2 and spin-1 fields in momentum space, in such a way that the appropriate boundary conditions are satisfied. This allows us to efficiently calculate loop diagrams in any given model. We give general expressions for the mass splittings among Kaluza-Klein modes within a given level. Our results can also be used to obtain interesting KK-parity preserving interactions among Kaluza-Klein modes. We pay special attention to the components of six-dimensional gauge fields that transform as scalars under the four-dimensional Lorentz group. These states provide a characteristic signature for these scenarios. In particular, we find that they can easily be the lightest particles in the Kaluza-Klein spectrum.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"70 pages, 15 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0512304","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-18T00:28:00Z","registered":"2022-03-18T00:28:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-18T00:28:01Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Using observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and Chandra X-ray Observatory, we derive sub-arcsecond localizations of the radio and X-ray afterglow of this GRB. We present near-infrared observations of the supernova SN 2003lw, which exploded in the host galaxy of the GRB 031203. Our deep, high resolution Magellan/PANIC data establish that this SN is spatially coincident with the radio and X-ray localizations of the afterglow of GRB 031203 to sub-arcsecond precision, and is thus firmly associated with the GRB. We use image differencing to subtract the bright emission from the host galaxy, and measure the time evolution of the SN between ~5 and ~50 days after the GRB. The resulting light curve has a shape which is quite different from that of the two SNe previously associated with GRBs, SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh. With SN 2003lw securely associated with this burst, we confirm that all three GRBs with redshifts z&lt;0.3 were accompanied by SN explosions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to ApJL.

Radio interferometric observations of the 21-cm line at high redshifts have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe during this time. However, modeling the evolution of these epochs is particularly challenging due to the complex interplay of many physical processes. This makes it difficult to perform the conventional statistical analysis using the likelihood-based Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which scales poorly with the dimensionality of the parameter space. In this paper, we show how the Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) through Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE) provides a step towards evading these issues. We use 21cmFAST to model the 21-cm power spectrum during CD-EoR with a six-dimensional parameter space. With the expected thermal noise from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), we are able to accurately recover the posterior distribution for the parameters of our model at a significantly lower computational cost than the conventional likelihood-based methods. We further show how the same training dataset can be utilized to investigate the sensitivity of the model parameters over different redshifts. Our results support that such efficient and scalable inference techniques enable us to significantly extend the modeling complexity beyond what is currently achievable with conventional MCMC methods.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, 9 figures.

Nevertheless, its energy bands can have non-trivial topological invariants like Chern numbers or winding numbers. By a thorough analysis for tight-binding models, it is proved that these invariants lead to bosonic edge modes which are robust to a large class of possibly disordered perturbations.

The fluctuating nature of the background constitutes the main source of uncertainty for any subtraction algorithm. Aiming at mitigating the effect of such fluctuations, we present a new method to estimate the background contribution to the transverse momentum on a jet-by-jet basis. Our approach is based on estimating the median background momentum density stored above a $p_{\\rm T}$-cut applied at the constituent level and an experimentally accessible correction term related to the signal contribution below the cut. This allows to trade part of the uncertainty due to background contamination for that of the signal below the cut, similarly to SoftKiller method. We propose to reduce the fluctuations of the latter by exploiting intrinsic correlations among the soft and hard sectors of QCD jets. Our data-driven approach is tested against PYTHIA8 and JEWEL di-jet events embedded in a thermal background and compared to the area-median and SoftKiller methods. The main result of this study is a $\\sim 5\\!-\\!40\\%$ improvement on the resolution of the reconstructed jet $p_T$ compared to previous methods in a high-luminosity proton-proton scenario.

These results closely resemble the properties of a recently discovered UFD, Tucana II, which is extremely metal-poor and has a spatially extended stellar halo with the more distant stars being more metal-poor. Our simulation suggests that the extended stellar halo of Tucana II may have been formed through a past major merger.

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component.

Our proof instead combines \"vector field\" commutators that capture the inherent symmetries of the relevant equations with conservation laws for mass and energy to get space-time weighted energy estimates. Combined with a simple version of Sobolev's inequality this gives pointwise decay as desired. In the case of the Vlasov and Schrodinger equations we can recover sharp pointwise decay; in the Schrodinger case we also show how to obtain local energy decay as well as Strichartz-type estimates. For the Airy equation we obtain a local energy decay that is almost sharp from the scaling point of view, but nonetheless misses the classical estimates by a gap.

Different approaches from the literature are compared and discussed. A special emphasis is put on the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin (KMR) distributions and their extension into the soft region. Sum rules for UPDFs are formulated and discussed in detail. We find a violation of naive number sum rules for the KMR UPDFs. An interesting interplay of perturbative (large $k_t^2$) and nonperturbative (small $k_t^2$) regions of UPDFs in the production of both soft and hard photons is identified. The $k_t$-factorization approach with the KMR UPDFs is inconsistent with the collinear approach at large transverse momenta of photons. Kwieci\u0144ski UPDFs provide very good description of all world data, especially at SPS and ISR energies. Off-shell effects are discussed and quantified. Predictions for the CERN LHC are given. Very forward/backward regions in rapidity at LHC energy are discussed and a possibility to test unintegrated gluon distributions (UGDF) is presented.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"19 pages, 23 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0606304","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-17T05:06:42Z","registered":"2022-03-17T05:06:47Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-17T05:06:47Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Especially, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing system, equipped with a visual tracking approach, has been widely used in aviation, navigation, agriculture,transportation, and public security, etc. As is mentioned above, the UAV-based aerial tracking platform has been gradually developed from research to practical application stage, reaching one of the main aerial remote sensing technologies in the future. However, due to the real-world onerous situations, e.g., harsh external challenges, the vibration of the UAV mechanical structure (especially under strong wind conditions), the maneuvering flight in complex environment, and the limited computation resources onboard, accuracy, robustness, and high efficiency are all crucial for the onboard tracking methods. Recently, the discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based trackers have stood out for their high computational efficiency and appealing robustness on a single CPU, and have flourished in the UAV visual tracking community. In this work, the basic framework of the DCF-based trackers is firstly generalized, based on which, 23 state-of-the-art DCF-based trackers are orderly summarized according to their innovations for solving various issues. Besides, exhaustive and quantitative experiments have been extended on various prevailing UAV tracking benchmarks, i.e., UAV123, UAV123@10fps, UAV20L, UAVDT, DTB70, and VisDrone2019-SOT, which contain 371,903 frames in total. The experiments show the performance, verify the feasibility, and demonstrate the current challenges of DCF-based trackers onboard UAV tracking.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Accepted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06255","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":2,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-02-24T13:41:27Z","registered":"2022-02-24T13:41:28Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-05-26T01:18:08Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Short-range forecasts are substantially affected by the specification of parameters in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The presence of a multitude of parameters and several output variables in the WRF model renders appropriate parameter value identification quite challenging. The objective of the current study is to reduce the uncertainty in the model outcomes through the recognition of parameters that strongly influence the model performance using a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) method. Morris one-step-at-a-time (MOAT), GSA method, is used to identify the sensitivities of 23 chosen tunable parameters corresponding to seven physical parameterization schemes of the WRF model. The sensitivity measures (MOAT mean and standard deviation) are evaluated for eleven output variables, out of which some are surface meteorological variables and the remaining are atmospheric variables, which are simulated by the WRF model with different parameters. Twelve high-intensity four day precipitation events during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 over the monsoon core region in India are considered for the study. Six out of 23 parameters have high MOAT mean in the case of almost all the model output variables indicating that these parameters have a considerable effect on the outcome of the simulations. MOAT mean values of a few parameters are noticeably small for all the model output variables, and thus the uncertainty associated with them has a negligible effect on the WRF model performance. The study also presents the physical insights into the trends of the parameter sensitivity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01353","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T18:50:22Z","registered":"2022-02-25T18:50:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T18:50:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

In particular, neural network models have proved to be adept at modeling processes with spatial-temporal complexity. Nevertheless, these highly parameterized models have garnered skepticism in their ability to produce outputs with quantified error bounds over the regimes of interest. Hence there is a need to find uncertainty quantification methods that are suitable for neural networks. In this work we present comparisons of the parametric uncertainty quantification of neural networks modeling complex spatial-temporal processes with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Stein variational gradient descent and its projected variant. Specifically we apply these methods to graph convolutional neural network models of evolving systems modeled with recurrent neural network and neural ordinary differential equations architectures. We show that Stein variational inference is a viable alternative to Monte Carlo methods with some clear advantages for complex neural network models. For our exemplars, Stein variational interference gave similar uncertainty profiles through time compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, albeit with generally more generous variance.Projected Stein variational gradient descent also produced similar uncertainty profiles to the non-projected counterpart, but large reductions in the active weight space were confounded by the stability of the neural network predictions and the convoluted likelihood landscape.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"27 pages, 20 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11179","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-02-20T03:42:52Z","registered":"2024-02-20T03:42:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2025-02-04T05:06:27Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We have accrued a large collection of dispersion measure (DM) measurements sensitive to the total electron content between Earth and the pulsars at each observation. All lines of sight cross through the solar wind which produces correlated DM fluctuations in all pulsars. We develop and apply techniques for extracting the imprint of the solar wind from the full collection of DM measurements in the recently released NANOGrav 11-yr data set. We filter out long time scale DM fluctuations attributable to structure in the interstellar medium and carry out a simultaneous analysis of all pulsars in our sample that can differentiate the correlated signature of the wind from signals unique to individual lines of sight. When treating the solar wind as spherically symmetric and constant in time, we find the electron number density at 1 A.U. to be $7.9\\pm0.2$ cm$^{-3}$. Our data shows little evidence of long-term variation in the density of the wind. We argue that our techniques paired with a high cadence, low radio frequency observing campaign of near-ecliptic pulsars would be capable of mapping out large-scale latitudinal structure in the wind.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"15 pages, submitted to ApJ","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07078","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T22:23:37Z","registered":"2022-03-01T22:23:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T22:23:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

During further processing in higher areas, information is subjected to a certain condensation process, which results in formation of abstract conceptual images of external world, apparently, represented as certain uniform spiking activity partially independent on the input spike trains details. Possible physical mechanism of condensation at the level of individual neuron was discussed recently. In a reverberating spiking neural network, due to this mechanism the dynamics should settle down to the same uniform/periodic activity in response to a set of various inputs. Since the same periodic activity may correspond to different input spike trains, we interpret this as possible candidate for information condensation mechanism in a network. Our purpose is to test this possibility in a network model consisting of five fully connected neurons, particularly, the influence of geometric size of the network, on its ability to condense information. Dynamics of 20 spiking neural networks of different geometric sizes are modelled by means of computer simulation. Each network was propelled into reverberating dynamics by applying various initial input spike trains. We run the dynamics until it becomes periodic. The Shannon's formula is used to calculate the amount of information in any input spike train and in any periodic state found. As a result, we obtain explicit estimate of the degree of information condensation in the networks, and conclude that it depends strongly on the net's geometric size.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 9 figures, 40 references.

In solid-state materials, phase transitions are deeply linked to the underlying symmetry breakings, resulting in a rich variety of emergent phases. Such symmetry breakings are often induced by controlling the chemical composition and temperature or applying an electric field and strain, etc. In this work, we demonstrate an ultrafast glide-mirror symmetry breaking in black phosphorus through Floquet engineering. Upon near-resonance pumping, a light-induced full gap opening is observed at the glide-mirror symmetry protected nodal ring, suggesting light-induced breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry. Moreover, the full gap is observed only in the presence of the light-field and disappears almost instantaneously ($\\ll$100 fs) when the light-field is turned off, suggesting the ultrafast manipulation of the symmetry and its Floquet engineering origin. This work not only demonstrates light-matter interaction as an effective way to realize ultrafast symmetry breaking in solid-state materials, but also moves forward towards the long-sought Floquet topological phases.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06752","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-12-10T04:26:44Z","registered":"2024-12-10T04:26:45Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-12-10T04:26:46Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We show that combined R and DRSR can provide more precise results. First, we conclude that the observed X_c(3872) and Z_c(3900) are tetramoles states (superposition of quasi-degenerated molecule and a tetraquark states having (almost) the same coupling to the currents) with the predicted masses: M_{T_{X_c}}=3876(44) MeV and M_{ T_{Z_c}}=3900(42) MeV. In the 2nd part, we focus on the analysis of the four-quark nature of different T_{QQqq'} 1^+ and 0^+ states within the 3_c3_c interpolating currents. The final results are summarized in Table 7. Combined R and DRSR calibrated to the observed X_c(3872) lead to a precise prediction of e.g. M_{T_{cc}^{1^+}}=3886(6) MeV. In a similar way, the DRSR for M_{T_{cc}^{0^+}}/M_{T_{cc}^{1^+}} calibrated to M_{T_{cc}^{1^+}} gives M_{T_{cc}^{0^+}}= 3883(3) MeV. The SU3 breaking ratios M_{T_{ccss}^{0^+}}/ M_{T_{cc}^{0^+}} lead to the improved mass predictions: M_{T_{ccss}^{0^+}}=3988(12) MeV. In the 3rd part, the analysis is extended to the beauty mesons, where we find the tetramole masses : M_{ T_{Z_b}}=10579(99) MeV and M_{X_b}=10545(131) MeV. We also observe that the T^{1^+,0^+}_{bbqq'} states are (almost) stable (within the errors) against strong interactions.

Following a discussion of the junction conditions and boundary terms in the action functional, the matching with the outer metric and event horizon is analyzed. We find that a distinct phenomenology arises when compared with standard results for the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse, namely the possibility of finite density black holes and the breaking of the no-hair theorem, due to a dependence of the end state of a black hole on the initial radius of the spherical body.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 3 figures; published version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6258","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-12T00:13:12Z","registered":"2022-03-12T00:13:13Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-12T00:13:13Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We also determine the size of selected charged current quasi-elastic samples in a 300-kton fiducial volume Super-Kamiokande-like detector from examples of both conventional super-beams and beta-beams proposed in the literature. With these samples, it is shown that full kinematic neutrino reconstruction using the outgoing proton can improve the reconstructed energy resolution, and give good neutrino versus anti-neutrino tagging capabilities, adding important capabilities to water Cherenkov detectors in future projects.

From a boiling pot of water to the complex dynamics of quantum many-body systems it provides a successful connection between the microscopic dynamics of atoms and molecules and the macroscopic properties of matter. However, statistical mechanics only describes the thermal equilibrium situation of a system, and there is no general framework to describe how equilibrium is reached or under which circumstances it can be reached at all. This problem is particularly challenging in quantum mechanics, where unitarity appears to render the very concept of thermalization counterintuitive. With the rapid experimental progress in the control and probing of ultracold quantum gases this question has become within reach of detailed experimental investigations. In these notes we present a series of experiments with ultracold one-dimensional Bose gases, which provide novel insights into this fundamental question.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"21 pages, 8 figures, Proceedings of the International School of Physics 'Enrico Fermi' - Course 191 'Quantum Matter at Ultralow Temperatures', (removed typos, corrected bibliography)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04288","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-08T18:30:08Z","registered":"2022-03-08T18:30:12Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-08T18:30:12Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Different expressions for transmittance and reflectance are obtained for even and odd values of the sample length which is the origin of their oscillatory behavior. In a weak amplifying medium, a cross-over length scale exists below which transmittance and reflectance increase exponentially and above which transmittance decays exponentially while the reflectance gets saturated. Depending on amplification transmittance and reflectance show singular behavior at the cross-over length. In a weak absorbing medium we do not find any cross-over length scale. The transmission coefficient behaves similar to that in an amplifying medium in the asymptotic limit. In a strong amplifying/absorbing medium, the transmission coefficient decays exponentially in the large length limit. In both weak as well as strong absorbing media the logarithm of the reflection coefficient shows the same behavior as obtained in an amplifying medium but with opposite sign.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"13 pages, Revtex, 5 ps figures included","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9806132","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-19T23:46:05Z","registered":"2022-03-19T23:46:06Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-19T23:46:06Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

There is a need for valid and practical ways to assess the protection provided. This paper develops some simple methods for disclosure limitation techniques which perturb the values of categorical identifying variables. The methods are applied in numerical experiments based upon census data from the United Kingdom which are subject to two perturbation techniques: data swapping (random and targeted) and the post randomization method. Some simplifying approximations to the measure of risk are found to work well in capturing the impacts of these techniques. These approximations provide simple extensions of existing risk assessment methods based upon Poisson log-linear models. A numerical experiment is also undertaken to assess the impact of multivariate misclassification with an increasing number of identifying variables. It is found that the misclassification dominates the usual monotone increasing relationship between this number and risk so that the risk eventually declines, implying less sensitivity of risk to choice of identifying variables. The methods developed in this paper may also be used to obtain more realistic assessments of risk which take account of the kinds of measurement and other nonsampling errors commonly arising in surveys.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-AOAS317 the Annals of Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2905","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-14T00:34:47Z","registered":"2022-03-14T00:34:48Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-14T00:34:48Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Nevertheless, experimental demonstration of this information-to-energy conversion has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a nonequilibrium feedback manipulation of a Brownian particle based on information about its location achieves a Szilard-type information-energy conversion. Under real-time feedback control, the particle climbs up a spiral-stairs-like potential exerted by an electric field and obtains free energy larger than the amount of work performed on it. This enables us to verify the generalized Jarzynski equality, or a new fundamental principle of \"information-heat engine\" which converts information to energy by feedback control.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"manuscript including 7 pages and 4 figures and supplementary material including 6 pages and 8 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5287","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T20:45:18Z","registered":"2022-03-13T20:45:19Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T20:45:19Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To ensure safe driving of automated vehicles, the vehicle must plan its trajectory to avoid navigating on unsafe roads (e.g., icy conditions, construction zones, narrow streets, etc.). Such information can be derived from the roads' physical properties, vehicle's capabilities, and weather conditions. From a GNSS-based navigation perspective, the reliability of GNSS signals in different locales, which is heavily dependent on the road layout within the surrounding environment, is crucial to ensure safe automated driving. An urban road environment surrounded by tall objects can significantly degrade the accuracy and availability of GNSS signals. This article proposes an approach to predict the reliability of GNSS-based navigation to ensure safe urban navigation. Satellite navigation reliability at a given location and time on a road is determined based on the probabilistic position error bound of the vehicle-mounted GNSS receiver. A metric for GNSS reliability for ground vehicles is suggested, and a method to predict the conservative probabilistic error bound of the GNSS navigation solution is proposed. A satellite navigation reliability map is generated for various navigation applications. As a case study, the reliability map is used in the proposed optimization problem formulation for automated ground vehicle safety-constrained path planning.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02584","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":3,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2022-06-07T01:40:00Z","registered":"2022-06-07T01:40:01Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-08-30T01:36:53Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

This is particularly unfortunate, because this is the range of variable DBV or V777 Her stars. Accurate atmospheric parameters are needed to help or confirm the asteroseismic analysis of these objects. Another important aspect is the new class of white dwarfs - the hot DQ - detected by Dufour et al. (2007), with spectra dominated by carbon lines. The analysis shows that their atmospheres are pure carbon. The origin of these stars is not yet understood, but they may have an evolutionary link with the hotter DBs as studied here. Our aim is to determine accurate atmospheric parameters and element abundances and study the implications for the evolution white dwarfs of spectral classes DB and hot DQ. High resolution UV spectra of five DBs are studied with model atmospheres. We determine stellar parameters and abundances or upper limits of C and Si. These objects are compared with cooler DBs below 20000K. We find photospheric C and no other heavy elements - with extremely high limits on the C/Si ratio - in two of the five hot DBs. We compare various explanations for this unusual composition, which have been proposed in the literature: accretion of interstellar or circumstellar matter, radiative levitation, carbon dredge-up from deeper interior below the helium layer, and a residual stellar wind. None of these explanations is completely satisfactory, and the problem of the origin of the hot DQ remains an open question.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6157","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-09T19:08:28Z","registered":"2022-03-09T19:08:29Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-09T19:08:29Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, current synthesis methods suffer from a variety of drawbacks, including limitations in crystal size and stability. Here, we report the fabrication of large-area, high-quality 2D tellurium (tellurene) using a substrate-free solution process. Our approach can create crystals with a process-tunable thickness, from monolayer to tens of nanometres, and with lateral sizes of up to 100 um. The chiral-chain van der Waals structure of tellurene gives rise to strong in-plane anisotropic properties and large thickness dependent shifts in Raman vibrational modes, which is not observed in other 2D layered materials. We also fabricate tellurene field-effect transistors, which exhibit air-stable performance at room temperature for over two months, on off ratios on the order of 106 and field-effect mobilities of around 700 cm2 per Vs. Furthermore, by scaling down the channel length and integrating with high-k dielectrics, transistors with a significant on-state current density of 1 A mm-1 are demonstrated.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06202","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T01:11:59Z","registered":"2022-03-05T01:12:00Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T01:12:00Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Previous numerical simulations of thermal instability and coronal rain formation have relied on artificially adding a coronal heating term to the energy equation. To reproduce large-scale characteristics of the corona, using more realistic coronal heating prescription is necessary. We analyse coronal rain formation and evolution in a 3-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation spanning from convection zone to corona which is self-consistently heated by magnetic field braiding as a result of convective motions. We investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of energy dissipation along coronal loops which become thermally unstable. Ohmic dissipation in the model leads to the heating events capable of inducing sufficient chromospheric evaporation into the loop to trigger thermal instability and condensation formation. The cooling of the thermally unstable plasma occurs on timescales comparable to the duration of the individual impulsive heating events. The impulsive heating has sufficient duration to trigger thermal instability in the loop but does not last long enough to lead to coronal rain limit cycles. We show that condensations can either survive and fall into the chromosphere or be destroyed by strong bursts of Joule heating associated with a magnetic reconnection events. In addition, we find that condensations can also form along open magnetic field lines.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"10 pages, 8 figures, accepted by A&amp;A","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03317","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-25T05:39:58Z","registered":"2022-02-25T05:39:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-25T05:39:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

The method relies on relating the discrete finite-volume spectrum of a quantum field theory with its scattering amplitudes. As the finite-volume spectrum can be directly determined in LQCD, this provides a method for determining scattering observables, and associated resonance properties, from the underlying theory. In a pair of papers published over the last two years, two of us have extended this approach to apply to relativistic three-particle scattering states. In this talk we summarize recent progress in checking and further extending this result. We describe an extension of the formalism to include systems in which two-to-three transitions can occur. We then present a check of the previously published formalism, in which we reproduce the known finite-volume energy shift of a three-particle bound state.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 3 figures, proceedings for XIIth Quark Confinement and the Hadron Spectrum (CONF12)","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05961","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-04T19:29:57Z","registered":"2022-03-04T19:29:58Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-04T19:29:58Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

They can also test its composition, probing the energy density and particle mass of different dark-matter and dark-energy components. CMB data have already shown that ultra-light axions (ULAs) with mass in the range $10^{-32}~{\\rm eV} \\to 10^{-26}~{\\rm eV}$ compose a fraction $&lt; 0.01$ of the cosmological critical density. Here, the sensitivity of a proposed CMB-Stage IV (CMB-S4) experiment (assuming a 1 arcmin beam and $&lt; 1~\u03bcK{\\rm-arcmin}$ noise levels over a sky fraction of 0.4) to the density of ULAs and other dark-sector components is assessed. CMB-S4 data should be $\\sim 10$ times more sensitive to the ULA energy-density than Planck data alone, across a wide range of ULA masses $10^{-32}&lt; m_{a}&lt; 10^{-23}~{\\rm eV}$, and will probe axion decay constants of $f_{a}\\approx 10^{16}~{\\rm GeV}$, at the grand unified scale. CMB-S4 could improve the CMB lower bound on the ULA mass from $\\sim 10^{-25}~{\\rm eV}$ to $10^{-23}~{\\rm eV}$, nearing the mass range probed by dwarf galaxy abundances and dark-matter halo density profiles. These improvements will allow for a multi-$\u03c3$ detection of percent-level departures from CDM over a wide range of masses. Much of this improvement is driven by the effects of weak gravitational lensing on the CMB, which breaks degeneracies between ULAs and neutrinos. We also find that the addition of ULA parameters does not significantly degrade the sensitivity of the CMB to neutrino masses.

Also, while there is a regular Hartle-Hawking-Israel-like state for the quantum theory between these two mirrors, there are coherent states built on it for which there are similar singularities in the expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor. We conjecture that in other situations with analogous enclosed horizons such as a (maximally extended) Schwarzschild black hole in equilibrium in a (stationary spherical) box or the (maximally extended) Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime, there will be similar stress-energy singularities and almost-singularities -- leading to instability of the horizons when gravity is switched on and matter and gravity perturbations are allowed for. All this suggests it is incorrect to picture a black hole in equilibrium in a box or a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole as extending beyond the past and future horizons of a single Schwarzschild (/Schwarzschild-AdS) wedge. It would thus provide new evidence for 't Hooft's brick wall model while seeming to invalidate the picture in Maldacena's 'Eternal black holes in AdS'. It would thereby also support the validity of the author's matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis and of the paper 'Brick walls and AdS/CFT' by the author and Ort\u00edz.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"28 pages, 4 figures.

The synthetic likelihood method derives an approximate likelihood function from a plug-in normal density estimate for the summary statistic, with plug-in mean and covariance matrix obtained by Monte Carlo simulation from the model. In this article, we develop alternatives to Markov chain Monte Carlo implementations of Bayesian synthetic likelihoods with reduced computational overheads. Our approach uses stochastic gradient variational inference methods for posterior approximation in the synthetic likelihood context, employing unbiased estimates of the log likelihood. We compare the new method with a related likelihood free variational inference technique in the literature, while at the same time improving the implementation of that approach in a number of ways. These new algorithms are feasible to implement in situations which are challenging for conventional approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods, in terms of the dimensionality of the parameter and summary statistic.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"30 pages; 7 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03069","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-05T19:52:51Z","registered":"2022-03-05T19:52:52Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-05T19:52:52Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

Defects in infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts can hinder the reliability of the automated deployment pipeline. We hypothesize that certain properties of IaC source code such as lines of code and hard-coded strings used as configuration values, show correlation with defective IaC scripts. Objective: The objective of this paper is to help practitioners in increasing the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts through an empirical study that identifies source code properties of defective IaC scripts. Methodology: We apply qualitative analysis on defect-related commits mined from open source software repositories to identify source code properties that correlate with defective IaC scripts. Next, we survey practitioners to assess the practitioner's agreement level with the identified properties. We also construct defect prediction models using the identified properties for 2,439 scripts collected from four datasets. Results: We identify 10 source code properties that correlate with defective IaC scripts. Of the identified 10 properties we observe lines of code and hard-coded string to show the strongest correlation with defective IaC scripts. Hard-coded string is the property of specifying configuration value as hard-coded string. According to our survey analysis, majority of the practitioners show agreement for two properties: include, the property of executing external modules or scripts, and hard-coded string. Using the identified properties, our constructed defect prediction models show a precision of 0.70~0.78, and a recall of 0.54~0.67.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1809.07937","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09605","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-01T09:39:41Z","registered":"2022-03-01T09:39:42Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-01T09:39:42Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

While there has been extensive effort in detecting such under-representation, resolution has remained a challenge. With recent advancements in generative AI, large language models and foundation models have emerged as versatile tools across various domains. In this paper, we propose Chameleon, a system that efficiently utilizes these tools to augment a data set with a minimal addition of synthetically generated tuples, in order to enhance the coverage of the under-represented groups. Our system follows a rejection sampling approach to ensure the generated tuples have a high quality and follow the underlying distribution. In order to minimize the rejection chance of the generated tuples, we propose multiple strategies for providing a guide for the foundation model. Our experiment results, in addition to confirming the efficiency of our proposed algorithms, illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, as the unfairness of the model in a downstream task significantly dropped after data repair using Chameleon.","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01071","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":1,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":1,"created":"2024-02-05T02:11:55Z","registered":"2024-02-05T02:11:56Z","published":null,"updated":"2024-12-03T05:28:31Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014, 10, 642] is presented and an implementation thereof is described. Results are presented for systems with periodicity in one, two and three dimensions as well as isolated molecules. The generalized Pipek--Mezey Wannier functions (PMWF) are highly localized orbitals consistent with chemical intuition where a distinction is maintained between \u03c3- and \u03c0-orbitals. The PMWF method is compared with the so-called maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF) that are frequently used for the analysis of condensed matter calculations. Whereas PMWFs maximize the localization criterion of Pipek and Mezey, MLWFs maximize that of Foster and Boys and have the disadvantage of mixing \u03c3- and \u03c0-orbitals in many cases. The PMWF orbitals turn out to be as localized as the MLWF orbitals as evidenced by cross-comparison of the values of the PMWF and MLWF objective functions for the two types of orbitals. Our implementation in the atomic simulation environment (ASE) is compatible with various representations of the wave function, including real-space grids, plane waves and linear combinations of atomic orbitals. The projector augmented wave formalism for the representation of atomic core electrons is also supported. Results of calculations with the GPAW software are described here, but our implementation can also use output from other electronic structure software such as ABINIT, NWChem and VASP.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"17 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06396","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-06T02:51:37Z","registered":"2022-03-06T02:51:38Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-06T02:51:38Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We have shown that this motion is highly elliptical, with a very long period of 525 cy to be compared with 430 d for the Earth. This is due to the very small dynamical flattening of Venus in comparison with our planet. In a second part we have computed precisely the Oppolzer terms which allow to represent the motion in space of the third Venus figure axis with respect to Venus angular momentum axis, under the influence of the solar gravitational torque. We have determined the corresponding tables of coefficients of nutation of the third figure axis both in longitude and in obliquity due to the Sun, which are of the same order of amplitude as for the Earth. We have shown that the coefficients of nutation for the third figure axis are significantly different from those of the angular momentum axis on the contrary of the Earth. Our analytical results have been validated by a numerical integration which revealed the indirect planetary effects.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"14 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in section 11.

Their importance has considerably grown recently thanks to the discovery that the trap like aging mechanism is directly controlling the out-of-equilibrium relaxation processes of more sophisticated spin models, that are considered as the solvable counterpart of real disordered systems. Establishing on a firmer ground the connection between these spin model out-of-equilibrium behavior and the trap like aging mechanism would shed new light on the properties, still largely mysterious, of the activated out-of-equilibrium dynamics of disordered systems. In this work we discuss numerical evidences of emergent trap-like aging behavior in a variety of disordered models. Our numerical results are backed by analytic derivations and heuristic discussions. Such exploration reveals some of the tricks needed to analyze the trap behavior in spite of the occurrence of secondary processes, of the existence of dynamical correlations and of finite system's size effects.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"25 pages, 15 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07936","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-03T20:02:22Z","registered":"2022-03-03T20:02:23Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-03T20:02:23Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

However, a physiological experiment typically captures an observable, or, in other words, a series of scalar measurements that characterize the temporal response of the physiological system under study; the dynamic variables that make up the state of the system at any time are not available. Therefore, only from the acquired observations should state vectors reconstructed to emulate the different states of the underlying system. It is what is known as the reconstruction of the state space, called phase space in real-world signals, for now only satisfactorily resolved using the method of delays. Each state vector consists of m components, extracted from successive observations delayed a time t. The morphology of the geometric structure described by the state vectors, as well as their properties, depends on the chosen parameters t and m. The real dynamics of the system under study is subject to the correct determination of the parameters t and m. Only in this way can be deduced characteristics with true physical meaning, revealing aspects that reliably identify the dynamic complexity of the physiological system. The biological signal presented in this work, as a case study, is the PhotoPlethysmoGraphic (PPG) signal. We find that m is five for all the subjects analyzed and that t depends on the time interval in which it evaluates. The H\u00e9non map and the Lorenz flow are used to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of applied techniques.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"12 pages, 12 figures with 37 subfigures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05410","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-02-26T23:09:40Z","registered":"2022-02-26T23:09:41Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-02-26T23:09:41Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We show that high-spin fermions with a spatially variable quadratic Zeeman coupling may allow for the creation of an inner spin-1/2 core surrounded by high-spin wings. The latter are always more entropic than the core at high temperatures and, remarkably, at all temperatures in the presence of frustration. Combining thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz with local density approximation, we study the spatial entropy distribution for the particular case of one-dimensional spin-3/2 lattice fermions in the Mott phase. Interestingly, this spatially dependent entropy opens a possible path for an adiabatic cooling technique that, in contrast to previous proposals, would specifically target the spin degree of freedom. We discuss a possible realization of this adiabatic cooling, which may allow for a highly efficient entropy decrease in the spin-1/2 core and help access antiferromagnetic order in experiments on ultracold spinor fermions.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"9 pages, 5 figures","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2606","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-13T22:45:54Z","registered":"2022-03-13T22:45:55Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-13T22:45:55Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

We detect X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) of the Si K-edge, characterized by a narrow and a broad absorption feature at 1846 and ~1865 eV, respectively. Comparison with ground experimental data indicates that most of the ISM Si exists in the form of silicates, although a composition of \"pure\" forsterite is ruled out. The XAFS spectra of the sulfur K-edge indicate that a significant fraction of S exists in the gas phase. From each source, we derive the column densities of Mg, S, Si, and Fe from the K-edge depth and that of O (or H) from the absorption of the continuum. The elemental abundance ratios are found to be consistent between the three targets: the mean values of O/Si, Mg/Si, S/Si, and Fe/Si are determined to be 0.55+-0.17, 1.14+-0.13, 1.03+-0.12, and 0.97+-0.31 solar, respectively (90% error in the mean value). We discuss the origins of the overabundances of the heavy metals relative to O in the Galactic ISM by comparison with the abundance pattern of the intracluster medium in clusters of galaxies. Assuming that most of the Mg and Si atoms are depleted into silicates of either the proxine or olivine family, we estimate that the number ratio of Mg to Fe in olivine is &gt;~1.2 and that 17%-43% of the total O atoms in the ISM must be contained in silicate grains.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"31 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ, vol. 620, 2005.

We find that fibers with a thick, round cladding show low FRD. We further demonstrate that the scrambling behavior of non-circular fibers is often complex and introduce a new metric to fully capture non-linear scrambling performance, leading to much lower scrambling gain values than are typically reported in the literature (&lt;1000 compared to 10,000 or more).

By considering an observer who analyzes a causal horizon in a generic spacetime, we first clarify how the asymptotic Planckian spectrum is imposed on the exponentially redshifted Hawking modes through a geometric dispersion mechanism developed by a semiclassical environment which is composed by all the modes that build up the curvature of the causal patch of the asymptotic observer. We also discuss the actual microscopic phenomenon of the Hawking evaporation of generic causal horizons. Our quantum description is based on a novel holographic scheme of gravitational open quantum systems in which the degrees of freedom that build up the curvature of the observer's causal patch interact with the radiated Hawking modes, initially as environmental quanta, and after a crossover time, as quantum defects. Planckian dispersion of the modes would only be developed in the strict thermodynamic limit of this quantum environment, called optimal disperser, which is nevertheless avoided holographically. Finally, we outline and characterize how our microscopic formulation of the observer-centric holography, beyond the AdS/CFT examples and for generic causal patches, does realize the information-theoretic processing of unitarity.","descriptionType":"Abstract"},{"description":"41 pages, Replaced with the published version","descriptionType":"Other"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02114","contentUrl":null,"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":"http://datacite.org/schema/kernel-4","source":"mds","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-03-07T11:47:48Z","registered":"2022-03-07T11:47:49Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-03-07T11:47:49Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"arxiv.content","type":"clients"}}}}

To explain the diversity of X-ray line profiles, we explore several possible geometrical models. Based on the highest signal-to-noise 2009 epoch, we find that a polar geometry with two distinct opening angle configurations and internal obscuration can successfully reproduce all of the observed line profiles. The best fit model consists of two plasma components: (1) a mildly absorbed (2$\\times$10$^{21}$\\,cm$^{-2}$), cooler ($\\approx$2\\,keV) with high Ne, Mg, Si, and S abundances associated with a wide polar interaction region (half-opening angle $\\approx$58$^{\\circ}$); (2) a moderately absorbed (2$\\times$10$^{22}$\\,cm$^{-2}$), hotter (&gt;~20\\,keV) plasma with high Fe abundances and strong internal obscuration associated with a narrow polar interaction region (half-opening angle $\\approx$20$^{\\circ}$). We extend this model to seven further epochs with lower signal-to-noise ratio and/or lower spectral-resolution between 2000-2018, yielding several interesting trends in absorption, flux, geometry and expansion velocity. We argue that the hotter and colder components are associated with reflected and forward shocks, respectively, at least at later epochs.
